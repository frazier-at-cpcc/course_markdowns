Finally, an affordable and simple GRC platform. Most organizations leverage spreadsheets, documents and/or collaboration portals, as well as email threads and individual calendars to manage their GRC initiatives. This is inefficient, error prone, costly, and a risk in itself.GRC is primarily a matter of “people and processes” and tools come second. However, old-school GRC offerings require many months of implementation and high consulting hours to stand up.
