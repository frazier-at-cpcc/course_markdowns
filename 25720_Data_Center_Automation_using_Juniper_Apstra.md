## Summary
This five-day course provides students with the foundational knowledge required to manage data center networks with Juniper Apstra software.
This class will provide attendees with the knowledge to operate and manage Juniper Apstra software. Attendees will be given a background on
modern data center design and intent-based networking concepts. 

The course covers the Juniper Apstra architecture and its data center reference
architecture including the designing, building, deploying, and automation of a threestage IP fabric with Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) overlay. The course goes on to
cover navigation of the Juniper Apstra UI including creating resources, designs,
templates, and instantiating blueprints (a running network). After teaching you to use
Juniper Apstra to build a running data center, the course reviews the operational
tools for managing a system with Juniper Apstra including basic troubleshooting,
global and blueprint UI walkthroughs, role-based access control, drain mode, adding
and removing nodes from a fabric, rolling back an entire network (Time Voyager),
creating on-box and off-box agents, configuring security policies, connectivity
templates, querying the graph database, and performing intent-based analytics (IBA).
Through demonstrations and hands-on labs, students will gain experience in
configuring and monitoring an IP fabric using Juniper Apstra. This course is based on
Juniper Apstra Release 4.0.1.
