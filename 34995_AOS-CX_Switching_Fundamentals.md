## Objective
After you successfully complete this course, expect to be able to:



- Identify the best HPE Aruba Networking switching portfolio products for various network types and sizes
- Install devices running the HPE Aruba networking AOS-CX network operating system
- Configure network segmentation using Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and Link Aggregation Groups (LAGs)
- Demonstrate creating network efficiency with stacking, virtualization, and routing such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
- Deploy secure management and maintenance methodologies

## Essentials
It is highly recommended that candidates already have basic knowledge of networking (knowing the OSI model, IP addressing, basic routing, etc.).  The Aruba Certified Network Technician (ACNT) course and certification is the perfect primer for this course.  The ACNT certification validates that you understand the different aspects of campus access both wireless and wired methodologies.

## Audience
The ideal candidate is someone starting a career as a networking IT professional.  They have six months of experience in the field.  Supporting or operating limited-scope wired network used in SMB, edge, and simple core environments. They are the junior member of the IT Operations team.
