## Summary
As enterprises seek to deploy and maintain increasingly complex cloud infrastructure, there is a necessity to use “Infrastructure as Code” (IaC) tools, like Terraform. An open-source, state management tool developed by HashiCorp, Terraform allows developers to use a common coding interface to work through their various clouds safely and efficiently. Attendees will leave being able to write and understand Terraform code (HCL), have a clear understanding of Terraform’s various components and supporting tools, as well as when to reach for Terraform over another IaC tool, such as Ansible.
