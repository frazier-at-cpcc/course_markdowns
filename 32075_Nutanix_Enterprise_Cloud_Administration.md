## Summary
If you already have experience with administering a Nutanix environment, this course will extend, deepen, and broaden your knowledge as you grow in your career as a Nutanix administrator.

Designed with Prism Central as the focal point, this course illustrates the breadth and depth of Nutanix’s centralized management capabilities, and allows you to explore the wide variety of features that are available in this one, single web console.

ECA is divided into four major sections:



- 1. Understanding core Nutanix concepts, such as hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) and the various Nutanix cloud solution packages. Also, the basic configuration of a cluster and the components that are needed to create and manage VMs – namely, networks and images.
- 2. Creating and managing VMs, how to protect VMs and their data, how to apply storage optimization features at the VM level, and how to migrate your workloads to a Nutanix environment.
- 3. Learn about alerts, events, log collection, reporting, and how to use various features in Prism Central to identify, analyze, and remediate performance issues.
- 4. Learn how to set up a cluster for maintenance activities – such as starting and stopping nodes and clusters – and how to manage and upgrade licenses and installed software with just a few clicks.
