## Summary
Please note attendees work together in teams of 5 as a minimum and the pricing advertised is per team of 5.

This OpenHack enables attendees to build a Power App that leverages the Dynamics 365 Healthcare Accelerator and key parts of the Power Platform, including Power Automate, AI Builder, Power BI, Data Connectors, and the Common Data Service (CDS), while also integrating with Microsoft Teams and Azure.

This OpenHack simulates a real-world scenario where Lamna Healthcare Company is a modern patient care organization that has already gone through their digital transformation journey. Now that their data lives on the Common Data Service, Lamna Healthcare’s management has requested a new round of improvements that enhance their proactive patient care. This involves implementing new requirements that will enable their care team to better manage their patients, predict patient health risks, and improve collaboration throughout the patient lifecycle.

During the “hacking” attendees will focus on creating a Power App for medical practitioners to better manage patients and linking it to the Common Data Service, building a custom connector and linking it to Azure Cognitive Services, using AI Builder to build an AI model, creating Power BI queries and visuals to satisfy reporting needs, creating an integration between Microsoft Teams and the Dynamics 365 Healthcare Accelerator app, and packaging their work into a managed solution to meet ALM best practices.

By the end of the OpenHack, attendees will have built out a technical solution that serves as an all-encompassing solution for the modern medical practitioner in the digital age, built on the building blocks of the Power Platform.
