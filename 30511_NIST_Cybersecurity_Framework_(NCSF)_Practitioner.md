## Summary
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NCSF) Practitioner Training course is designed for individuals within an organization who are directly involved in the planning, design, creation, implementation, and or improvement of a cybersecurity program that will follow the principles of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Although some aspects of the course are technical, this course also includes risk management, business controls, and other topics that would be of value to staff outside of the traditional technical audience.



- Two-day deep dive into Foundation concepts.
- Focus on designing and implementing (or improving) a cybersecurity program to minimize risks and protect critical assets based on the NIST CSF.
- Provides a detailed analysis of various technical and business controls, including the Center for Internet Security 18 Critical Security Controls, the ISO 27001: 2013 Information Security Management System, and the ISO 27002: 2013 Code of Practice.
