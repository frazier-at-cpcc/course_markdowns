## Summary
This 2-day course introduces learners to the data integration capability of Google Cloud using Cloud Data Fusion. In this course, we discuss the challenges of data integration and the need for a data integration platform (middleware). We then examine how
Cloud Data Fusion can help effectively integrate data from a variety of sources and formats and generate insights. We look at the main components of Cloud Data Fusion and how they work, how to process batch and streaming data in real time with visual pipeline design, rich metadata and data lineage tracking, and how to deploy data pipelines on various runtime engines.
