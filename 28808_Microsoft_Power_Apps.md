## Outline
Module 1: An Introduction to PowerApps


Let’s get started with an introduction to Microsoft PowerApps. Traditionally building customized 

solutions for a business involved using a coding language to build an application from scratch. Typically, 

these solutions could often only be used within the business, making external use of the application a 

large hurdle to overcome. With PowerApps we can now not only easily build solutions, but we can also 

share them with users in our business. Deployment takes seconds and you could by testing your own 

app on your phone in no time. This module will overview the features of PowerApps, its benefits to a 

business and the variety of ways you can build and access your apps on different devices.

Module 2: Getting Started with PowerApps


To begin our journey through the PowerApps product, we will begin by looking at some of the templates 

that are available to view and edit. Microsoft’s templates are a good starting point to discover what the 

product is capable off and how it can be achieved. We will also take the chance to have a tour of the 

editor so that students are familiar with the interface that they will be using over the two-day course. 

We will then build our first app from a static data source, showing students how to test their changes in 

the app instantly without the need to publish. We will also discuss how to configure your apps settings 

and how to access the app once it has been saved and shared.

our applications. The drive behind this module is to provide more depth on the categories of controls 

which can be used on a form. Your instructor will take you through each control and discuss its purpose 

and configuration. Tackling the wide selection of controls will help students recognize when to use the 

right control.

Module 5: Data Sources and Logic


To help maintain and view essential business information, organizations often have a diverse selection 

of locations to keep different types of data. This could range from databases to file storage locations. 

PowerApps offers connections to a wide selection of data sources. We will show students to build their 

PowerApps to bring in data from a variety of sources as well as how they can utilize the common data 

source, a storage location unique to PowerApps.

involve a different development process to canvas apps. We will review this development process 

during this module. Model-Driven apps can be quicker to build than canvas apps, but they are less 

customizable and typically have a higher cost, knowing which type of app to use is not always a simple 

decision, we will show you the pros and cons of each.
