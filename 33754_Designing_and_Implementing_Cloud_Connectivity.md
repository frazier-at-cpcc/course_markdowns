## Summary
The Designing and Implementing Cloud Connectivity training helps you develop the skills required to design and implement enterprise cloud connectivity solutions. You will learn how to leverage both private and public internet-based connectivity to extend the enterprise network to cloud providers. You will explore the basic concepts surrounding public cloud infrastructure and how services like Software as a Service (SaaS) can be integrated. You will practice how to analyze and recommend connectivity models that provide the best quality of experience for users. You will learn to implement both Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) and Software-Defined Wide-Area Network (SD-WAN) cloud connectivity, as well as build overlay routing with Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Finally, you will practice troubleshooting cloud connectivity issues relating to IPsec, SD-WAN, routing, application performance, and policy application. 

This training prepares you for the 300-440 ENCC exam. If passed, you earn the Cisco Certified Specialist–Enterprise Cloud Connectivity certification and satisfy the concentration exam requirement for the Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP) Enterprise certification.
