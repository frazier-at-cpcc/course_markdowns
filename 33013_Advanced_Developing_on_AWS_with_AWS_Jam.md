- Apply Twelve-Factor Application manifesto concepts and steps while migrating from a monolithic architecture
- Recommend the appropriate AWS services to develop a microservices based cloud-native application
- Use the AWS API, CLI, and SDKs to monitor and manage AWS services
- Migrate a monolithic application to a microservices application using the 6 Rs of migration
- Explain the SysOps and DevOps interdependencies necessary to deploy a microservices application in AWS
- Work in a team environment to solve real AWS use-case challenges in an AWS Jam

## Essentials
We recommend that attendees of this course have:


- In-depth knowledge of at least one high-level programming language
- Working knowledge of core AWS services and public cloud implementation
- Completion of the Developing on AWS (AWSD) classroom training, and then a minimum of 6 months of application of those concepts in a real world environment

## Summary
The Advanced Developing on AWS course uses the real-world scenario of taking a legacy, on-premises monolithic application and refactoring it into a serverless microservices architecture. This four-day advanced course covers advanced development topics such as architecting for a cloud-native environment; deconstructing on-premises, legacy applications and repackaging them into cloud-based, cloud native architectures; and applying the tenets of the Twelve-Factor Application methodology.

The final day is an AWS Jam, a gamified event, with teams competing to score points by completing a series of challenges according to established best practices based on concepts covered in the course. You get to experience a wide range of AWS services in a series of real-world scenarios that represent common operational and troubleshooting tasks. The end result is developing, enhancing, and validating your skillsets in the AWS Cloud through real-world problem solving, exploring new services, features, and understanding how they interoperate.
