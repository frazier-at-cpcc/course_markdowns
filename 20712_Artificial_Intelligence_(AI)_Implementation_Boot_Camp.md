## Audience
This artificial intelligence course is for anyone that is strategically contributing to the adoption of machine learning and AI features into their projects and applications.

## Outline
Part 1: Introduction



- Working definitions: AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning,  Data Science & Big Data
- State of AI: summarizing major analysts’ statistics & predictions
- Summarizing AI misinformation
- Effects on the job market
- Today’s AI use  cases
- What do high profile uses have in common?
- Addressing legitimate concerns & risks
- Case study break: We will introduce the class to three real-world use cases – one in finance, one in health science, and one in general operations. In small groups, you will discuss implications of the cases and see if you and your peers can spot any parallel opportunities in your own business.

    Part 2: The Big Data Prerequisite



- Evaluating your big data practice
- State of tools – understanding intelligent big data stacks
- Strategically restructuring enterprise data architecture for AI
- Unifying data engineering practices
- Datasets as learning data
- Defeating Bias in your Datasets
- Optimizing Information Analysis
