## Objective
This course is about 50% hands-on lab to 50% lecture ratio, combining engaging, informed instructor presentations, demonstrations and discussions with extensive machine-based student labs and practical project work. Throughout the course students will learn to write essential Python scripts using the most current and efficient skills and techniques.  

Working within in an engaging, hands-on learning environment, guided by our expert instructor, students will learn to: 


- Thinking as a Software Developer, including coding logic and structures
- Create working Python scripts following best practices
- Use python data types appropriately
- Read and write files with both text and binary data
- Search and replace text with regular expressions
- Get familiar with the standard library and its work-saving modules
- Create "real-world", basic level professional Python applications
- Use Python scripting basics for automating day to day tasks
- Know when to use collections such as lists, dictionaries, and sets
- Understand Pythonic features such as comprehensions and iterators
- Write robust code using exception handling

## Essentials
Before attending this course, students must have:


- Ability to use computers to start programs, open and save files, navigate application menus and interfaces
- Ability to understand logical concepts such as comparisons
- Understand number theory
- Ability to create, understand, and follow structured directions or step-by-step procedures
- Ability to understand and apply abstract concepts to concrete examples

## Audience
This course provides an excellent kick start for users new to Python and scripting or programming, enabling them to use basic Python skills on the job in a variety of ways. This in a basic-level Python course geared for student who are new to Software Development and use Python in projects, or  system administrators and web site administrators who want to use Python to support their server installations, as well as anyone else who wants to automate or simplify common tasks with the use of Python scripts.
