## Summary
Email has become one of the most widely used methods of communication, whether for personal or business communications. In most organizations, large or small, email is the preferred form of communicating information among employees. As email grows in popularity and use, most organizations have found the need to implement a corporate mail management system such as Microsoft Outlook to handle the messages and meeting invitations sent among employees. In this course, students will use Outlook to send, receive, and manage email messages; manage their contact information; schedule appointments and meetings; create tasks and notes for themselves; and customize the Outlook interface to suit their working style. 

Note: Most Office 365 users perform the majority of their daily tasks using the desktop version of the Office software, so that is the focus of this training. The course material will also enable students to access and effectively utilize many web-based resources provided with their Office 365 subscription. This includes brief coverage of key skills for using Outlook on the Web and OneDrive. Helpful notes throughout the material alert students to cases where the online version of the application may function differently from the primary, desktop version. 

This course is the first in a series of two Microsoft Outlook for Office 365 courses. It will provide students with the basic skills they need to start using Outlook to manage their email communications, contact information, calendar events, tasks, and notes. This course covers the Microsoft Office Specialist Program exam objectives to help students prepare for the Outlook Associate (Office 365 and Office 2019): Exam MO-400 certification exam.
