## Objective
After successfully completing this course, you will be able to: 


- Describe IP multicast traffic flow .
- Identify the components of IP multicast.
- Explain how IP multicast addressing works.
- Describe the need for reverse path forwarding (RPF) in multicast.
- Explain the role of IGMP and describe the available IGMP versions.
- Configure and monitor IGMP.
- Identify common multicast routing protocols.
- Explain the differences between dense-mode and sparse-mode protocols.
- Describe rendezvous point (RP) discovery options.
- Describe bidirectional PIM.
- Configure and monitor rendezvous point discovery mechanisms.
- Configure bidirectional PIM sparse mode.
- Explain the purpose and operation of MSDP.
- Describe the usage of MSDP within a single PIM domain with anycast-RP.
- Describe the usage of MSDP across multiple PIM domains.
- Configure and monitor MSDP.
- Compare the any-source multicast (ASM) and source-specific multicast (SSM) service models.
- Describe the basic requirements, benefits, and caveats of SSM.
- List the address ranges used for SSM.
- Illustrate the role of IGMPv3 and PIM-SM in an SSM implementation.
- Configure and monitor SSM.
- Describe the default PIM sparse mode information distribution.
- Explain how routing policies control IGMP joins.
- Explain how routing policies alter PIM protocol message flow.
- Identify the role of a policy in controlling MSDP message advertisement.
- Explain how you can use a policy to scope multicast groups.
- Configure and monitor PIM dense mode and PIM sparse mode.
- Describe IPv6 multicast addresses.
- Describe IPv6 multicast scoping.
- Compare IPv6 Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) versions with IPv4’s IGMP protocol versions.
- Describe IPv6 SSM.

## Essentials
- Basic networking knowledge and an understanding of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and the TCP/IP protocol suite. Students should also have working knowledge of security policies.
- Students should also attend the Introduction to the Operating System (IJOS), (!) , and JUNOS Intermediate Routing (JIR) courses prior to attending this class.

## Audience
This course benefits individuals responsible for implementing, monitoring, and troubleshooting multicast components in a service provider’s network.
