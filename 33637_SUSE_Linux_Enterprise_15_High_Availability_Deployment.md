## Objective
During this course you will learn to: 


- Plan and prepare to implement a SLE HA cluster
- Install SLE HA and create a Corosync/Pacemaker cluster
- Use the administration tools available to administer a cluster
- Configure node fencing
- Deploy and configure an arbitrator system to provide additional votes to the quorum system
- Add an additional node to an existing cluster

## Essentials
Students require a good knowledge of SLES15. Some familiarity with the basic concepts of clustering for HA would be useful but not required.

## Audience
This course is designed for existing Linux administrators who want to deploy a highly availability cluster using the SUSE Linux Enterprise HA Extension. This course provides a foundation for deploying SAP on SLE 15 HA.

## Outline
Not available

## Summary
This course teaches students to deploy and configure the SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) 15 High Availability (HA) product to be ready to deploy workloads. The course introduces the product features and implementation planning for both on premise and public cloud implementations. A SLE15 HA cluster is deployed and then configured to provide corosync network redundancy. Next the fencing configuration is updated which includes adding a quorum arbitrator system. The cluster configuration is then tested before an additional node is added to the existing cluster. 

This course prepares students for the SCDS in SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability exam.
