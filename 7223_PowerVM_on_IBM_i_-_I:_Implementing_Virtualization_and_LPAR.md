- Identify virtualization options available, reliability features and single points of failure for Power Systems
- Implement System Planning Tool in design or update your own system
- Explain Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT)
- Describe memory allocation and affinity concepts
- Describe and configure a partition profile, including shared processors:
- Capped
- Uncapped
- Virtual processors
- Weighting factor
- Shared Processor Pools
- Explain virtual I/O: Serial, Ethernet and SCSI
- Understand and implement: IBM i installation through NFS, image virtual repository in VIOS, and assigning VSCSI disks to partitions in VIOS
- Understand base characteristics of IVM and how to implement IBM i on Power Blades
- Describe the NPIV PowerVM feature, how to configure virtual Fiber Channel adapters on the Virtual I/O Server and client partitions
- Discuss how to use the HMC GUI and commands to work with the World Wide Port Name (WWPN) pairs
- Identify commands used to examine the NPIV configuration

## Essentials
You should have:



	- some knowledge of Power Systems architectural concepts
- some experience with Power Systems
