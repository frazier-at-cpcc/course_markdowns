## Summary
The Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) Advanced for Python Programmers (NSO300) v4.0 course continues the learning journey of the NSO Essentials for Programmers and Network Architects (NSO201) v4.0 course with NSO to include customizing templates with Python programming, Docker deployment, and Nano services. You will learn to create advanced services using the NSO application framework and Python scripting with both new and existing Layer 3 Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) VPN services. You will also learn how to manage and scale these services to reduce operation consumption, and increase both security and available physical space, since Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) replace physical hardware. You will use Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) orchestration features, and Cisco Elastic Services Controller (ESC) to manage virtualized network functions.

This course will help you:


- Tailor a Cisco Network Services Orchestrator solution for your organization
- Manage virtualized network functions (VNFs) automated, efficient, and dynamic network functioning
