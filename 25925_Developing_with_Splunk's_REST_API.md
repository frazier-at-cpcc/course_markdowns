## Summary
This 9-hour course is for developers who want to use the Splunk REST API to interact with Splunk servers. In this course, use curl and Python to send requests to Splunk REST endpoints and learn how to parse and use the results. Create a variety of objects in Splunk, learn how to change properties, work with and apply security to Splunk objects, run different types of searches and parse its results, ingest data using the HTTP Event Collector and manipulate collections and KV Stores.

Please note that this class may run over two days, with 4.5 hour sessions each day, with a total of nine hours of content.
