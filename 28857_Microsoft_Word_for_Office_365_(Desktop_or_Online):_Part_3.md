Being able to manipulate graphics and efficiently create, manage, revise, and distribute long documents and forms can help a user’s organization create important and interesting documents. Implementing time-saving features that enable users to work well in a collaborative mode that will benefit both the user and the user’s organization. Constructing document elements that ensure user’s readers have access to pertinent information at the click of a button, while at the same time protecting sensitive information, is another important skill. Mastering these skills and techniques will make users a valued employee in their organization.

Note: Most Office 365 users perform the majority of their daily tasks using the desktop version of the Office software, so that is the focus of this training. The course material will also enable users to access and effectively utilize many web-based resources provided with your Office 365 subscription. Helpful notes throughout the material alert users to cases where the online version of the application may function differently from the primary, desktop version.
