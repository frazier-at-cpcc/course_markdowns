## Summary
This course covers the deployment of Rancher Kubernetes Engine 2 (RKE2). You will start by learning the basics of installing RKE2, and then progress to installing a highly available RKE2 cluster. Next, you will delve into installing additional clusters with different configurations, Including custom Kubernetes Addons as an auto deployed service, advanced networking such as the Multus CNI plugin, and CIS hardening. Additionally, you will learn how to install a cluster in an air-gapped environment. After performing the different cluster installations, you will backup and restore an RKE2 cluster. Finally, you will learn how to upgrade both standard and air-gapped RKE2 clusters.
