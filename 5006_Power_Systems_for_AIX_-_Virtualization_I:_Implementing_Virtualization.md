**Category ID**: nan
**Modality**: 6
**Active**: True
**Language**: en
**Product Code**: AN30G
**Vendor Code**: IB
**Vendor Name**: IBM

## Objective
- Configure virtual SCSI devices that are backed by physical volumes, logical volumes, and optical media devices
- Configure the Optical Media Repository, load a CD image, and use it to install a new AIX partition
- Configure virtual Fibre channel devices using NPIV technology
- Configure Ethernet link aggregation for load balancing and backup channel in the VIOS
- Configure Shared Ethernet adapter failover and load sharing
- Configure vNIC failover
- Perform Virtual I/O Server maintenance operations

## Essentials
You must have advanced system administration experience with AIX 6 or AIX 7. This prerequisite can be met by attending one of the following courses:

Power Systems for AIX II: Implementation and Administration (AN12G) 

Power Systems for AIX III: Advanced Administration and Problem Determination (AN15G) 

AIX Jumpstart for UNIX Professionals (AN14G)

Alternatively, you must have equivalent AIX and LPAR skills.

General TCP/IP knowledge is strongly recommended.

You are also expected to have logical partition administration skills on Power Systems servers, which can be obtained by attending Power Systems for AIX I: LPAR Configuration and Planning (AN11G).

## Audience
This advanced course is appropriate for System Administrators, Technical Support Personnel, and Business Partners responsible for implementing LPARs on IBM Power Systems with AIX servers.
