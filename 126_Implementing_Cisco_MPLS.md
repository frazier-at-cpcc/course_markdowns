## Summary
The Implementing Cisco Multiprotocol Label Switching training teaches you the high-performance method for forwarding packets through a network. MPLS enables routers at the edge of a network to apply simple labels to packets. This practice allows the edge devices to switch packets according to labels, with minimal lookup overhead. MPLS integrates the performance and traffic-management capabilities of data link Layer 2 with the scalability and flexibility of network Layer 3 routing. When used in conjunction with other standard technologies, MPLS gives the ability to support value-added features.
 
How You'll Benefit


- Acquire the skill of implementing MPLS high-performance methods for forwarding packets in a network
- Learn to configure routers at the network edge to apply simple labels to packets
- Gain the knowledge to enable edge devices, ATM switches, or existing routers to switch packets based on labels within the service provider core
- Master the skill of minimizing lookup overhead in the packet-switching process
- Gain proficiency in integrating the performance and traffic-management capabilities of data-link Layer 2 using MPLS
- Acquire the skill of combining the scalability and flexibility of network Layer 3 routing through MPLS
- Learn to leverage MPLS with other standard technologies to implement value-added features for service providers' networks
