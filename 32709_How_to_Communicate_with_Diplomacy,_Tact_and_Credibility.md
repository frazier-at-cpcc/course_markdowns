## Summary
How well you communicate can make or break your professional image. It directly influences how others view your work and performance—as well as your prospects for career advancement and mobility.

To be a communicator who is skilled in all three areas, it takes awareness, training and the know-how to apply proven techniques to all kinds of situations.

This seminar will teach you how to choose and use the most appropriate words and emotional tone for every business interaction. You will gain insights into your communication style and the styles of others, while building skills to clearly and effectively receive and transmit information, ideas, thoughts, feelings and needs.
