## Summary
Whether students need to crunch numbers for sales, inventory, information technology, human resources, or other organizational purposes and departments, the ability to get the right information to the right people at the right time can create a powerful competitive advantage. After all, the world runs on data more than ever before and that's a trend not likely to change, or even slow down, any time soon. But with so much data available and being created on a nearly constant basis, the ability to make sense of that data becomes more critical and challenging with every passing day. Students already know how to get Microsoft Excel to perform simple calculations and how to modify their workbooks and worksheets to make them easier to read, interpret, and present to others. But, Excel is capable of doing so much more. To gain a truly competitive edge, students need to be able to extract actionable organizational intelligence from their raw data. In other words, when they have questions about their data, they need to know how to get Excel to provide the answers for them. And that's exactly what this course aims to help students do. 

This course builds upon the foundational knowledge presented in the Microsoft Excel for Office 365 (Desktop or Online): Part 1 course and will help start students down the road to creating advanced workbooks and worksheets that can help deepen their understanding of organizational intelligence. The ability to analyze massive amounts of data, extract actionable information from it, and present that information to decision makers is at the foundation of a successful organization that is able to compete at a high level. 

Note: Most Office 365 users perform the majority of their daily tasks using the desktop version of the Office software, so that is the focus of this training. The course material will also enable students to access and effectively utilize many web-based resources provided with their Office 365 subscription. This includes brief coverage of key skills for using Excel for the Web and OneDrive. Helpful notes throughout the material alert students to cases where the online version of the application may function differently from the primary, desktop version. 

This course covers Microsoft Office Specialist Program exam objectives to help students prepare for the Excel Associate (Office 365 and Office 2019): Exam MO-200 and Excel Expert (Office 365 and Office 2019): Exam MO-201 certifications.
