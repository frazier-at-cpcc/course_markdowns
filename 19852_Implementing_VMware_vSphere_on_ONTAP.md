## Objective
This course focuses on enabling you to do the following:



- List the three core ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere
- Identify the types of datastores that ONTAP tools create
- Explain how ONTAP tools enable automated datastore provisioning for VM lifecycle management
- Describe the vVols datastore-management process
- Define ONTAP FlexGroup NAS datastores and illustrate quality-of-service (QoS) policy management for VMs in a FlexGroup volume
- Use the VMware vCenter UI to implement enhanced QoS policies
- Describe SRA features
- Describe NetApp VASA Provider features
- Use ONTAP tools to create vVols datastores and objects
- Use ONTAP tools to identify vVols performance characteristics
- Use ONTAP tools dashboards to monitor VMs
- List customer implementations for backup, restore, and cloning when integrating vSphere with NetApp
- Implement best practices for connectivity, provisioning, data layout, and multipathing
- Use ONTAP tools to access the Swagger UI and improved RESTful APIs for automation
- Use the NetApp SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere to configure and run backup and restore jobs
- List the best data protection solutions for a vSphere environment and discuss the benefits of these solutions

## Essentials
The following training classes or equivalent knowledge are recommended: 


- ONTAP Cluster Administration (ONTAP9ADM) and ONTAP Data Protection Administration (DATAPROT9)
- ONTAP SAN Administration (SANADM)
- VMware Fundamentals (free web-based training from VMware Education)
- VMware vSphere: Install, Configure, Manage [V7] (VSICM7)

## Audience
NetApp employees, channel partners and customers who implement virtualization solutions with NetApp storage systems.

- Storage policies and profiles
- Managing VVols
- On-Demand moving, copying and restoring of virtual disks

Module 5: Monitoring Performance and Quality of Service (QoS)


- VSC performance dashboards
- NetApp QoS features
- NetApp and VMware QoS use cases

Module 6: Data Protection

## Summary
In this course, you learn how to manage VMware vSphere virtualization solutions with NetApp® ONTAP® data management software. You learn how to use NetApp ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere and other ONTAP solutions to deploy, manage, and protect the VMware virtual infrastructure on ONTAP based storage systems in both SAN and NAS environments. The course introduces you to the ONTAP tools Virtual Storage Console (VSC), NetApp VMware vSphere API for Storage Awareness (VASA) Provider, and Storage Replication Adapter (SRA). You also learn how to use the NetApp SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere to configure backup and recovery.
