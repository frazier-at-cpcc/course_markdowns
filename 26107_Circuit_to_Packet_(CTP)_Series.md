## Outline
Introduction to CTP

This module provides an overview of Circuit to Packet (CTP) devices. It explains the drawbacks of legacy end devices and applications and describes the advantages of using CTP devices in an IP/MPLS network.

Legacy Devices

This module provides an overview of Circuit to Packet (CTP) devices. It explains the drawbacks of legacy end devices and applications and describes the advantages of using CTP devices in an IP/MPLS network.

CTP Application Examples

This module explains the different application examples where the Circuit to Packet (CTP) is used and how it provides value to these applications.

CTP Hardware

This module covers the hardware devices associated with the Circuit to Packet (CTP)

CTP Initial Configuration

This module describes the basic configuration of Circuit to Packet (CTP) and also explains the network configurations of the CTP device.

CTP Ethernet Segregation Circuit/Management

This module describes the process to separate the circuit traffic from the management traffic over different Ethernet interfaces on a Circuit to Packet (CTP). Each CTP has at least two Ethernet interfaces. This module describes how to force the circuit traffic at one interface and the management traffic at a different interface.

CTP Security Profile Menu

This module provides an overview of the Security Profile Menu options. It also describes how to configure the security profile through the Node Operations menu. The module then describes the four different types of users and the four different security levels of access to the system. It also explains the management of users, passwords, secure logs, login banner, security level, and port forwarding through the different options of the Security Profile Configuration Menu.

CTP Encapsulation

This module describes the different encapsulation types that the CTP uses. Encapsulation refers to the process of taking legacy non-IP traffic and placing it into an IP packet.

CTP Circuit Provisioning

This module explains how to configure circuits for provisioning bundles in a Circuit to Packet (CTP) system.

CTP Bundle Configuration Serial

This module describes how to configure CTP bundle configuration for T1 and E1.

CTP Bundle Configuration: T1 and E1

This module describes the process to separate the circuit traffic from the management traffic over different Ethernet interfaces on a Circuit to Packet (CTP). Each CTP has at least two Ethernet interfaces. This module describes how to force the circuit traffic at one interface and the management traffic at a different interface.

CTP Bundle Configuration Analog Voice: 4WE&M, 2WFXS, 2WFXO

This module explains about the analog bundle voice configurations for 4WE&M, 2WFXS, and 2WFXO.

CTP CESoPSN Bundle for Hairpinning

This module describes the hairpinning configuration for a Circuit Emulation Service over Packet-Switched Network (CESoPSN) bundle. The module also explains the limitations of hairpinning.

CTP Y-Cable Redundancy

This module explains the importance of using the Y-cable redundancy option in Circuit to Packet (CTP). The module also describes the five different modes for Y-cable redundancy. It then explains how to set up the Y-cable redundancy option in CTP.

CTP Clocking

This module describes the two CTP clocking options, the system clocking options and the per port clocking options.

CTP Buffering

This module describes the process of Circuit to Packet (CTP) buffering and also explains the basic configuration of CTP buffering.

CTP NTP Timezone

This module explains how to set up the NTP timezone on a Circuit to Packet (CTP) device. It also explains some limitations of setting up the NTP timezone on CTP.

CTP Bundle States and Troubleshooting

This module explains the different Circuit to Packet (CTP) bundle states. It also explains how to troubleshoot to isolate problems on the CTP.

CTPView Web-Based Network Management

This module explains how to manage all the CTPs in a network using the CTPView, a Web-based network management application.

## Summary
This course will introduce the CTP Series access products and use cases. The course will describe the different hardware options and interfaces, and explain the steps needed to initially configure the CTP. This course will go into detail on the configuration options for accessing the CTP locally and remotely. Configuration of each interface type will be covered along with the node and circuit timing/sync options available. Jitter buffers and troubleshooting circuits will be covered. The CTPView network management application for configuration, software upgrades, database storage, monitoring, BERTs, loop-backs and graphing of performance information will be covered.
