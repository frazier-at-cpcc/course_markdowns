## Objective
Impact on the organization

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform has as much potential to improve operational efficiency for network automation and administration as it does for traditional system administration automation. By effectively using the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, the network administration team can improve the efficiency, repeatability, quality, and consistency of its work and the organization's network infrastructure. In addition, by using Ansible, the same tools used to manage Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Microsoft Windows systems can be used to manage network infrastructure, enabling cross-platform commonality of tools and easier auditing of automation. This course is optimized for learners who are already experienced network administrators, but who do not have much experience with Ansible.

Impact on the individual

As a result of attending this course, you will be able to use Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform to write Ansible Playbooks and launch them to manage the routers, switches, and other devices in your network infrastructure. You will have experience with using Ansible to automate several common use cases and have a basic understanding of how to write playbooks that can target devices made by different network hardware vendors supported by Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.

## Essentials
- Take our free assessment to gauge whether this offering is the best fit for your skills
- Experience with network administration, including a solid understanding of TCP/IP, routers, and managed switches
- Familiarity with managing network devices from the command line, preferably with one or more of Cisco IOS, IOS XR, or NX-OS; Juniper Junos; or Arista EOS
- Knowledge equivalent to Red Hat System Administration I (RH124) or better is recommended
- Prior Ansible knowledge is not required

## Audience
This course is designed for network administrators, network automation engineers, and infrastructure automation engineers who are responsible for deploying, managing, and automating the network infrastructure of their organization or enterprise.
