## Objective
This training is designed to enable a SOC, CERT, CSIRT, or SOAR engineer to start working with Cortex XSOAR integrations, playbooks, incident-page layouts, and other system features to facilitate resource orchestration, process automation, case management, and analyst workflow. 
The course includes coverage of a complete playbook-development process for  automating a typical analyst workflow to address phishing incidents. This end-to-end view of the development process provides a framework for more focused discussions of individual topics that are covered in the course.

## Essentials
Participants must complete the Cortex XSOAR Analyst digital learning. Participants who have experience with scripting, the use of Python and JavaScript, and the use of JSON data objects will likely be able to apply what they learn more quickly than participants without such experience. However, completion of the course does not require proficiency in writing code.

## Audience
Security-operations (SecOps), or security, orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) engineers, managed security service providers (MSSPs), service delivery partners, system integrators, and professional services engineers.
