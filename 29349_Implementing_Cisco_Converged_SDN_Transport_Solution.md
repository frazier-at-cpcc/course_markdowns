## Summary
The Implementing Converged SDN Transport Solutions (SPSDNTXP) v1.0 course introduces you to Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-ready architecture. This architecture evolves traditional Metro network design into an SDN-enabled programmable network capable of delivering all services (residential, business, 5G mobile backhauling, video, and IoT) on the premise of simplicity, full programmability, and cloud integration with guaranteed service level agreements (SLAs).

You will examine the evolution of service provider design principles such as Unified Multiprotocol Label Switching, Evolved Programmable Networks, and the Cisco® Compass Metro Fabric. Additionally, you’ll explore and configure individual components of the design including segment routing and its supporting features.

This course will help you:


- Describe the Converged SDN Transport solution
- Describe the basic implementation of SDN component features
- Establish a foundation to take a deeper dive into SDN solutions
