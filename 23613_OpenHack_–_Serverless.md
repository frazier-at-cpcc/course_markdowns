## Audience
- Target Audience:

- Microsoft – CSE, CSA
- Customer – App Developers
- Target verticals: Cross-Industry
- Customer profile: Examples:

- Modern Application Development – customers looking to build cloud native applications and use Platform as a Service (PaaS) services on Azure to remove the overhead of infrastructure management and reduce the time to market for applications. High focus on rapid application developed.
- Event Driven Distributed Architecture – customers looking to architected solution that rely on messaging services for communication between systems and services and focus on async processing for effective scaling and management.

## Outline
Not available

## Summary
Please note attendees work together in teams of 5 as a minimum and the pricing advertised is per team of 5.”

This OpenHack enables attendees to quickly build and deploy Azure Serverless solutions that are comprised of cutting-edge compute services like Functions, Logic Apps, Event Grid, Service Bus, Event Hubs and Cosmos DB.

This OpenHack simulates a real-world scenario where an ice cream company wants to use Platform as a Service (PaaS) to build and release an API to integrate into their distributor’s application.

During the “hacking” attendees will focus on:


- Building serverless functions, web APIs, and CI/CD pipeline to support them
- Implementing Serverless technologies to integrate line-of-business app workflows, process user/data telemetry and create business KPI-aligned reports.


By the end of the OpenHack, attendees will have built out a technical solution that is a full serverless solution that can create workflows between systems and handle events, files, and data ingestion.
