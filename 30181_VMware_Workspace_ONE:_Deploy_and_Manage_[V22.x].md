## Summary
In this five-day course, you learn how to apply the fundamental techniques for launching and maintaining an intelligence-driven, multi-platform endpoint management solution with VMware Workspace ONE® UEM. Through a combination of hands-on labs, simulations, and interactive lectures, you will configure and manage the endpoint life cycle. After the course, you will have the foundational knowledge necessary to implement Workspace ONE UEM effectively.

You will also learn how to apply the fundamental techniques for integrating VMware Workspace ONE® Access™ with Workspace ONE UEM to securely distribute business-critical applications and configure access management controls from any device. Through a combination of hands-on labs, simulations, and interactive lectures, you configure enterprise, productivity, and Workspace ONE Access integrations.

This course lays out the principles of identity and access management. You will leave with a fundamental understanding of how Workspace ONE uses various authentication methods and protocols to determine user access permissions and enable single sign-on.


Please note - This course is a combination of the VMware Workspace ONE: Skills for UEM and the VMware Workspace ONE: Integrations course.
