## Outline
Introducing Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform

Describe the fundamental concepts of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform and how it is used, and install Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.

Implementing an Ansible playbook

Create an inventory of managed hosts, write a simple Ansible playbook, and run the playbook to automate tasks on those hosts.

Managing variables and facts

Write playbooks that use variables to simplify management of the playbook and facts to reference information about managed hosts.

Implementing task control

Manage task control, handlers, and task errors in Ansible playbooks.

Deploying files to managed hosts

Deploy, manage, and adjust files on hosts managed by Ansible Automation Platform.

Managing complex plays and playbooks

Write playbooks for larger, more complex plays and playbooks.

Simplifying playbooks with roles

Use Ansible Automation Platform roles to develop playbooks more quickly and to reuse Ansible Automation Platform code.

Troubleshooting Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform

Troubleshoot playbooks and managed hosts.

Automating Linux administration tasks

Automate common Linux system administration tasks with Ansible Automation Platform.

Develop Playbooks with Ansible Automation Platform 2

Develop Ansible Playbooks with Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2 following recommended practices.

Manage Content Collections and Execution Environments

Run playbooks that use Ansible Content Collections not included in Ansible Core, either from an existing execution environment or by downloading them from automation hub.

Run Playbooks with Automation Controller

Explain what automation controller is and use it to run playbooks that you developed with automation content navigator.

Work with Ansible Configuration Settings

Examine and adjust the configuration of Ansible and automation content navigator to simplify development and to troubleshoot issues.

Manage Inventories

Manage inventories by using advanced features of Ansible.

Manage Task Execution

Control and optimize the execution of tasks by Ansible Playbooks.

Transform Data with Filters and Plugins

Populate, manipulate, and manage data in variables using filters and plug-ins.

Coordinate Rolling Updates

Use advanced features of Ansible to manage rolling updates in order to minimize downtime and to ensure maintainability and simplicity of Ansible Playbooks.

Create Content Collections and Execution Environments

Write your own Ansible Content Collections, publish them, embed them in a custom automation execution environment, and run them in playbooks by using automation controller.

Installing Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform

Explain what Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform is and perform a basic installation of automation controller and automation hub.

Managing User Access

Create user accounts and organize them into teams/groups in automation controller and automation hub, and assign them permissions to administer and access resources in each service.

Managing Inventories and Machine Credentials

Create inventories of machines to manage, and configure credentials necessary for automation controller's execution nodes to log in and run Ansible jobs on those systems.

Managing Projects and Launching Ansible Jobs

Create projects and job templates in the web UI, using them to launch Ansible Playbooks that are stored in Git repositories, in order to automate tasks on managed hosts.

Advanced Job Configuration

Configure advanced features of automation controller in order to more effectively and efficiently implement jobs.

Constructing Job Workflows

Use advanced features of job templates to improve performance, simplify the customization of jobs, launch multiple jobs, schedule automatically recurring jobs, and provide notification of job results.

Managing Advanced Inventories

Manage inventories that are generated dynamically from scripts or the automation controller smart inventory feature.

Automating Configuration of Ansible Automation Platform

Automate the configuration and deployment of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform services by using Ansible Content Collections, the automation controller API, and Git webhooks.

Maintaining Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform

Perform routine maintenance and administration of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.

## Summary
Learn how to automate Linux system administration tasks with Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform and manage complex automation workflows at scale and prevent single points of failure.

The Ansible Automation Platform Boot Camp (DO710) is designed for Linux administrators and developers who need to automate repeatable and error-prone steps for system provisioning, configuration, application deployment, and orchestration. Learn recommended practices for automation development using reusable code, advanced playbook techniques, shared execution environments, and preparing for scalable automation with the automation content navigator. Deploy automation controller to centrally manage automation workflows, automation mesh to scale up and distribute execution capacity, and private automation hub to manage Ansible Content Collections and automation execution environments for use by automation developers.
