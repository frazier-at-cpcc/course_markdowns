## Objective
In this Windows 10 Power Workshop, you'll learn everything you need to know to deploy Windows 10 in your environment quickly and on target.

Here it goes from full-touch to lite-touch to zero-touch - according to the wishes of the participants. The different versions and in particular the LTSB version are closely examined. Furthermore, the configuration via MDT and ADK will be examined in detail and a basic configuration will be provided in advance. Subsequently, the management of the client system via group policies is discussed in order to enforce central specifications, including data protection. (Switching off telemetry data, secure data protection configuration, etc.). Following on from this, the topic of security is examined centrally and in depth: from pass-the-hash and credential guard to device guard and remote credential guard, to mention just a few topics.

The goal of this five-day seminar is to familiarize you with Windows 10 in such a way that you can virtually "juggle" with the new operating system and successfully implement this new operating system in your environment.

Especially the topic of a deployment of Windows 10 as a highly secure client is one of the central approaches here. And: Can and do you or your customers not want to buy the LTSB/LTSC version? We show you how to configure a Windows 10 Pro version with 30 group policies so that it corresponds to an LTSB version. And: You can take these group policies (among others) with you as an export after this course and use them directly.

This course has been developed since the beta of Windows 10 and is always evolving to match the latest versions of Windows 10. In particular, the experiences of our customers are always incorporated into this course.

After attending this course you will have no (!) more questions about Windows 10 - Promised!
