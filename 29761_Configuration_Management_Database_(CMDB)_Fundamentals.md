## Summary
Attend Configuration Management Database (CMDB) Fundamentals to learn how to implement a successful CMDB, configure rules to prevent duplicates, and populate data from various sources. In this three-day interactive workshop, start your journey to becoming familiar with the ServiceNow CMDB. Participants learn design principles including how to configure, populate, automate, and maintain the health of their CMDB. IMPORTANT: Both the on demand and instructor-led training do not provide a course guide. All content is contained in the CMDB Learning Path.

The advantages of taking the live course versus solely the on demand offering are the following:



- Learn from an industry-experienced instructor who can answer questions as needed
- Observe live instructor-led demos that help drive understanding of key concepts
- Learn using step by step hands-on exercises developed specifically for the live class including an end of class project
- Network and learn from peers attending the class
- Complete hands-on simulator tasks with the support of your instructor and peers to assess the skills learned

At the end of this training, students can obtain both a CMDB Configuration and CMDB Health micro-certification.

This course content mirrors the on demand CMDB Fundamentals course currently available on Now Learning. The course is designed to encourage student participation that includes individual and group planning, discussions as well as hands-on configuring of the ServiceNow CMDB.
