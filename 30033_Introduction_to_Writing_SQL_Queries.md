## Summary
A company’s success hinges on responsible, accurate database management. Organizations rely on highly available data to complete all sorts of tasks, from creating marketing reports and invoicing customers to setting financial goals. Data professionals like analysts, developers and architects are tasked with creating, optimizing, managing and analyzing data from databases – with little room for error. When databases aren’t built or maintained correctly, it’s easy to mishandle or lose valuable data. Our SQL Programming and Database Training Series provides students with the skills they require to develop, analyze and maintain data and in correctly structured,  modern and secure databases.

SQL is the cornerstone of all relational database operations. In this hands-on course, you learn to exploit the full potential of the SELECT statement to write robust queries using the best query method for your application, test your queries, and avoid common errors and pitfalls. It also teaches alternative solutions to given problems, enabling you to choose the most efficient solution in each situation.

NOTE: This course uses SQL Developer. SQL Developer is not the focus of the course, but rather the platform for learning the SQL querying skills.  Students are NOT required to have prior experience with SQL Developer. All tools are provided in our easy-access, no-install required, cloud-based environment.
