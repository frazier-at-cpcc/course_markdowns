## Summary
The Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) Administration and DevOps training continues the learning journey of the NSO Essentials for Programmers and Network Architects and NSO Advanced for Python Programmers trainings by introducing you to the system administration and DevOps focusing on NSO. This includes the robust bridge linking network automation and orchestration tools, examining the development, operation, and administration task functions. You will learn how to set up, configure, deploy, and maintain a Cisco NSO solution, and learn best practices for using DevOps. The examples shown in this training demonstrate real-world scenarios to prepare you for deployment and management of new or existing NSO instances.  

The training guides you through the setup of production-ready NSO instances using system installation with access control settings, the deployment of NSO in Docker containers, and introduces modern DevOps concepts and tools such as Git and Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). You will learn how to migrate Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) devices, how to build Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) Network Element Drivers (NEDs) from the NSO Command-Line Interface (CLI), how to handle NSO Alarms, and many more features that benefit you in your journey with Cisco NSO.
