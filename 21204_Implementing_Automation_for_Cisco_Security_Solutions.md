## Summary
The Implementing Automation for Cisco Security Solutions (SAUI) course teaches you how to design advanced automated security solutions for your network. Through a combination of lessons and hands-on labs, you will master the use of modern programming concepts, RESTful Application Program Interfaces (APIs), data models, protocols, firewalls, web, Domain Name System (DNS), cloud, email security, and Cisco速 Identity Services Engine (ISE) to strengthen cybersecurity for your web services, network, and devices. You will learn to work within the following platforms: Cisco Firepower速 Management Center, Cisco Firepower Threat Defense, Cisco ISE, Cisco pxGrid, Cisco Stealthwatch速 Enterprise, Cisco Stealthwatch Cloud, Cisco Umbrella速, Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP), Cisco Threat grid, and Cisco Security Management Appliances. This course will teach you when to use the API for each Cisco security solution to drive network efficiency and reduce complexity.

This course prepares you for 300-735 Automating and Programming Cisco Security Solutions (SAUTO) certification exam. Introducing Automation for Cisco Solutions (CSAU) is required prior to enrolling in Implementing Automation for Cisco Security Solutions (SAUI) because it provides crucial foundational knowledge essential to success. This course also earns you 24 Continuing Education (CE) credits towards recertification.
