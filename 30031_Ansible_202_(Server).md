## Summary
Continue your studies of Ansible, with a focus on automating servers and applications. In addition to Ansible, students will study enough Python to understand Ansible’s plugin architecture. Lessons and labs focus on using both Python and Ansible to interact with and configure your Linux and Windows servers, as well as common applications. At the conclusion of this course you will return to work empowered with skills necessary to create or improve Ansible solutions. This class is a combination of live demonstrations and hands-on labs with virtual network devices and endpoints as targets for your configuration.

For many of the lessons, we use the Dell PowerEdge (including the iDRAC and RedFish APIs) as a source of reference and study. However, the lessons are transferable to all server platforms. Linux and Windows are both covered.
