## Objective
Upon successful completion of this course, participants should be able to:


- Immediately participate and contribute as a Data Science Team Member on big data and other analytics projects by:

- Deploying the Data Analytics Lifecycle to address big data analytics projects
- Reframing a business challenge as an analytics challenge
- Applying appropriate analytic techniques and tools to analyze big data, create statistical models, and identify insights that can lead to actionable results
- Selecting appropriate data visualizations to clearly communicate analytic insights to business sponsors and analytic audiences
- Using tools such as: R and RStudio, MapReduce/Hadoop, in-database analytics, Window and MADlib functions
- Explain how advanced analytics can be leveraged to create competitive advantage and how the data scientist role and skills differ from those of a traditional business intelligence analyst

## Essentials
To complete this course successfully and gain the maximum benefits from it, a student should have the following knowledge and skillsets:



- A strong quantitative background with a solid understanding of basic statistics, as would be found in a statistics 101 level course.
- Experience with a scripting language, such as Java, Perl, or Python (or R).  Many of the lab examples taught in the course use R (with an RStudio GUI), which is an open source statistical tool and programming language.
- Experience with SQL (some course examples use PSQL).
Consider the above as a list of specific prerequisite (or refresher) training and reading to be completed prior to enrolling for or attending this course. Having this requisite background will help ensure a positive experience in the class, and enable students to build on their expertise to learn many of the more advanced tools and analytical methods taught in the course.

## Audience
This course is intended for individuals seeking to develop an understanding of Data Science from the perspective of a practicing Data Scientist, including:



- Managers of teams of business intelligence, analytics, and big data professionals
- Current Business and Data Analysts looking to add big data analytics to their skills.
- Data and database professionals looking to exploit their analytic skills in a big data environment
- Recent college graduates and graduate students with academic experience in a related discipline looking to move into the world of Data Science and big data
- Individuals seeking to take advantage of the EMC Proven™ Professional Data Scientist Associate (EMCDSA) certification
