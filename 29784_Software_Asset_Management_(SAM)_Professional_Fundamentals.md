Attend Software Asset Management Professional Fundamentals to learn how to set up an effective Software Asset Management (SAM) practice. Setting up an effective Software Asset Management (SAM) practice includes key milestones: planning a design, defining policies, identifying the information required and how that information can be obtained, what the software asset processes should look like, and how the technology can support these items.

Investing time and careful consideration to build out the SAM practice produces a higher quality outcome.
