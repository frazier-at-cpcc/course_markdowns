## Essentials
This course is intended for students who have experience with the core components of Kubernetes.  

It is suggested that students take the Certified Kubernetes Administrator course prior to taking the Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist course. However, instructors will always strive to assure every student gains a very thorough understanding of the material covered, regardless of the students’ prior experience. Furthermore, this course has already taken into consideration the attendance of less experienced learners.

Finally, experience and knowledge of Linux fundamentals is strongly recommended.
