## Summary
Dataplex is an intelligent data fabric that enables organizations to centrally discover, manage, monitor, and govern their data across data lakes, data warehouses, and data marts. You can use Dataplex to build a data mesh architecture to decentralize data ownership among domain data owners.

In this course, you will learn how to discover, manage, monitor, and govern your data across data lakes, data warehouses, and data marts through guided lectures and independent exercises using sample data.

This course does not cover the interaction of Dataplex with Dataproc Metastore nor does it do a deep dive into BigLake concepts.
