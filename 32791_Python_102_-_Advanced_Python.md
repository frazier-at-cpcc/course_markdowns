- code points, and escape sequences
- How to use "in" and "not in"
- The functions "ord()" and "chr()"
- Controlling I/O flow
- text vs binary modes
- handles vs streams
- predefined streams
- bytearray for I/O buffering
- Why "open()" and "close()" (what are they actually doing?)
- The case for "with"
4. Object-Oriented Programming


- Classes
- Objects
- Objects and Properties
- Inheritance

- PyUnit framework
8. Intro to GUI Programming


- Using tkinter
- Creating buttons and frames
- Interacting with users
- Color modes RGB and HEX
- Widget properties and methods
- Checking input and handling errors
9. DevSecOps


- DevOps vs DevSecOps
- DevSecOps tools that quickly improve your Python code
- Fuzz testing Python APIs
- Checking your code for secrets with gitleaks
- (Optional) Automating tests with GitHub Actions
- (Optional) Automating test with GitLab CI/CD Pipelines

## Summary
This course begins with an expectation that students have had previous exposure to programming with Python, and understand the subjects outlined in Alta3 Python 101 - Essentials. The primary goals of this course include Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) structure and techniques, organizing code into user-defined modules and packages, error handling, and testing.

GitHub Actions or GitLab pipelines will be used to highlight the latest DevSecOps practices. Attendees will enable open source tools related to improving the usability and security of their Python scripts.

This course prepares students for the learning objectives found on Python Instituteâ€™s PCEP, PCAP and most of the PCPP1.

Class is a combination of live instructor demo and hands-on labs.
