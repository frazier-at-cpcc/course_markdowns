## Objective
After taking this course, you should be able to:



- Analyze the components needed for a root cause analysis report
- Apply tools such as YARA for malware identification
- Recognize the methods identified in the MITRE attack framework
- Leverage scripting to parse and search logs or multiple data sources such as, Cisco Umbrella, Sourcefire IPS, AMP for Endpoints, AMP for Network, and PX Grid
- Recommend actions based on post-incident analysis
- Determine data to correlate based on incident type (host-based and network-based activities)
- Evaluate alerts from sources such as firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), data analysis tools (such as, Cisco Umbrella Investigate, Cisco Stealthwatch, and Cisco SecureX), and other systems to responds to cyber incidents and recommend mitigation
- Evaluate elements required in an incident response playbook and the relevant components from the ThreatGrid report
- Analyze threat intelligence provided in different formats (such as, STIX and TAXII)
