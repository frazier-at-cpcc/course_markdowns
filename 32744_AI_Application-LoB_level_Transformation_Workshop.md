## Summary
This workshop covers the second phase of the AI Adoption Framework; application-level AI solutions. Participants will learn to identify opportunities for AI that can be implemented by replacing an entire process or work flow in its entirety. This is the second step to using AI to substantially change what and how work gets done and moves companies beyond augmenting specific functions with AI.  Entire work domains will be examined and opportunities to modify it substantially using AI will be explored, work domains include: sales, marketing, HR, finance, engineering, operations, logistics, and others. Participants will explore their selected domain, consisting of multiple functions, and re-image that domain, or key sub-areas, to embrace AI capabilities end to end. Reengineering specific applications sets the stage for understanding how to reengineer entire systems.
