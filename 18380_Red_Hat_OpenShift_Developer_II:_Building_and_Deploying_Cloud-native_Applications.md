## Objective
Impact on the organization

This course provides application developers with the essential skills to design, build, and deploy containerized applications, whether they are migrating existing applications to Red Hat OpenShift, or creating new cloud-native applications. It provides the gateway to organizational and digital transformation by demonstrating the potential of DevOps using a container-based architecture.

As developers seek ways to improve application time to market for minimum viable products, containers and Red Hat OpenShift have quickly become the de facto solution for agile development and application deployment. A container-based architecture, orchestrated with Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift, improves application reliability and scalability while decreasing developer overhead and facilitating continuous deployment. Red Hat OpenShift provides the ability to consistently develop and deploy these applications in AWS using Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), in Microsoft Azure using Azure Red Hat OpenShift, or as a self-managed Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform running in public cloud or customer datacenter environments.

Red Hat has created this course in a way intended to benefit our customers, but each company and infrastructure is unique, and actual results or benefits may vary.

Impact on the individual

You will learn about the fundamental concepts behind containerizing, scaling, deploying, and managing applications in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You will acquire these skills:


- Design container images to containerize applications.
- Different ways to build, deploy and manage containers.
- Deploy multi-container applications.
- Implement health checks to improve system reliability.
- Create and run automated pipelines for continuous delivery.
