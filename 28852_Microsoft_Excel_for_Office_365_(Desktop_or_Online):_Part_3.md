## Summary
By now, students are already familiar with Excel, its functions and formulas, a lot of its features and functionality, and its powerful data analysis tools. They are likely called upon to analyze and report on data frequently, work in collaboration with others to deliver actionable organizational intelligence, and keep and maintain workbooks for all manner of purposes. At this level of use and collaboration, students have also likely encountered their fair share of issues and challenges. Students are too busy, though, to waste time scouring over workbooks to resolve issues or to perform repetitive, monotonous tasks. Students need to know how to get Excel to do more for them so they can focus on what's really important: staying ahead of the competition. That's exactly what this course aims to help students do. 

This course builds upon the foundational and intermediate knowledge presented in the Microsoft Excel for Office 365 (Desktop or Online): Part 1 and Microsoft Excel for Office 365 (Desktop or Online): Part 2 courses to help students get the most of their Excel experience. The ability to collaborate with colleagues, automate complex or repetitive tasks, and use conditional logic to construct and apply elaborate formulas and functions will put the full power of Excel right at their fingertips. The more students learn about how to get Excel to do the hard work for them, the more they'll be able to focus on getting the answers they need from the vast amounts of data their organization generates. 

Note: Most Office 365 users perform the majority of their daily tasks using the desktop version of the Office software, so that is the focus of this training. The course material will also enable students to access and effectively utilize many web-based resources provided with their Office 365 subscription. This includes brief coverage of key skills for using Excel for the Web and OneDrive. Helpful notes throughout the material alert students to cases where the online version of the application may function differently from the primary, desktop version. 

This course covers Microsoft Office Specialist Program exam objectives to help students prepare for the Excel Associate (Office 365 and Office 2019): Exam MO-200 and Excel Expert (Office 365 and Office 2019): Exam MO-201 certifications.
