## Summary
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (AI & ML JumpStart) is a three-day, foundation-level, hands-on course that explores the fast-changing field of artificial intelligence (AI). programming, logic, search, machine learning, and natural language understanding. Students will learn current AI / ML methods, tools, and techniques, their application to computational problems, and their contribution to understanding intelligence. 

In this course, we will cut through the math and learn exactly how machine learning algorithms work. Although there is clearly a requirement for the students to have an aptitude for math, this course is about focusing on the algorithms that will be used to create machine learning models. Using clear explanations, simple pure Python code (no libraries!) and step-by-step labs, you will discover how to load and prepare data, evaluate model skill, and implement a suite of linear, nonlinear and ensemble machine learning algorithms from scratch. 

This course presents a wide variety of related technologies, concepts and skills in a fast-paced, hands-on format, providing students with a solid foundation for understanding and getting a jumpstart into working with AI and machine learning. Each topic area presents a specific challenge area, current progress, and approaches to the presented problem.  Attendees will exit the course with practical understanding of related core skills, methods and algorithms, and be prepared for continued learning in next-level, more advanced follow on courses that dive deeper into specific skillsets or tools.
