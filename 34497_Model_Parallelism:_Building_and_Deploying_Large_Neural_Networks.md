## Summary
Very large deep neural networks (DNNs), whether applied to natural language processing (e.g., GPT-3), computer vision (e.g., huge Vision Transformers), or speech AI (e.g., Wave2Vec 2) have certain properties that set them apart from their smaller counterparts. As DNNs become larger and are trained on progressively larger datasets, they can adapt to new tasks with just a handful of training examples, accelerating the route toward general artificial intelligence. Training models that contain tens to hundreds of billions of parameters on vast datasets isn’t trivial and requires a unique combination of AI, high-performance computing (HPC), and systems knowledge.
