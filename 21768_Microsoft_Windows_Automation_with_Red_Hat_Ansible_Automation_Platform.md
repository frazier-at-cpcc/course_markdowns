## Essentials
You are expected to have experience as Windows Server administrators, but no previous experience with Red Hat Ansible Automation or LinuxÂ® is required.


- This class will require internet access.
- You will be expected to "bring your own device" (BYOD).
- Your device must be installed with a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

- If you are running Microsoft Windows, you should have Microsoft Remote Desktop installed.
- If you are running macOS, you will need to install Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac (by Microsoft) from the App Store.
- If you are running Linux, you may install Remmina from their distribution (if available) or following instructions at https://remmina.org (if not).  If they prefer, they may instead install the FreeRDP clients from their Linux distribution (in the freerdp package in Red Hat Enterprise Linux).
