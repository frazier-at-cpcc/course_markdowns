## Outline
Module 1 – Writing Your First SignalFlow Program



- Identify where SignalFlow is used in Splunk Observability Cloud
- Create plots using SignalFlow instead of the Plot Builder
- Query streaming data
- Add filters to streaming data queries
- Combine filters with and, or, not
Module 2 – Working with Data Streams in Splunk Observability Cloud



- Describe the fundamentals of Data Stream objects
- Use aggregation functions to analyze streaming data
- Apply transformations to streaming data
- Change resolutions, rollups, and extrapolation policies when querying streaming data
Module 3 – Stream aggregations, transformations, and calculations



- Use combining operators on streams
- Operate on data streams with missing data
- Use the map() method to modify or exclude values in a stream
- Describe variable assignment in SignalFlow
- Differentiate between SignalFlow functions and methods
- Describe and use SignalFlow functions that have equivalent methods
Module 4 – Detecting and Alerting in SignalFlow



- Use the detect() function to monitor a stream
- Use comparisons to create Boolean streams
- Create constant streams and use them appropriately
- Specify different "on" and "off" conditions for a detect block
- Identify durations of an occurrence in streaming data
- Compare streams using different thresholds for different MTSs
- Create alerts rules that align with detectors
Module 5 – Advanced Detecting and Stream Manipulation



- Work with properties and dimensions in SignalFlow
- Compare values using multiple thresholds and a default
- Use built-in library functions
- Use conditional, list, and other Python-like functionality
- Write reusable functions in SignalFlow
Module 6 – The SignalFlow REST API



- Explain the SignalFlow APIs available and common use cases
- Execute a SignalFlow program using the HTTP API
- Describe the data format returned by the HTTP API
- Explain how Terraform is used to manage Infrastructure Monitoring resources in Splunk Observability Cloud
- Create detectors and alert rules using the REST API
