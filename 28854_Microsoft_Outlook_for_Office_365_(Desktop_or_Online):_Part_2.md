## Summary
Every day, millions of email messages are exchanged among people within and between organizations. Email has a ubiquitous presence in the lives of many, and it's likely that email technologies will continue to evolve with the changing needs of workplaces. After all, email communication has not been replaced, or its growth slowed, as many predicted with the rise of social media and the widespread adoption of mobile technologies. Many organizations have implemented mail management systems that combine the back-end power of Microsoft Exchange Server and the front-end intuitive user interface of Microsoft Outlook. 

In this course, students will customize command sets, configure mail accounts, set global options, perform advanced searches, apply filters to intercept mail and control spam, create rules to automate mail management tasks, work with calendars and contacts, manage tasks, preserve data with archives and data files, as well as share and delegate access to their Outlook items. In short, students will work with a wide range of features and options and, in so doing, understand why Outlook is a leading personal management system. 

Note: Most Office 365 users perform the majority of their daily tasks using the desktop version of the Office software, so that is the focus of this training. The course material will also include helpful notes throughout the material to alert students to cases where the online version of the application may function differently from the primary, desktop version. 

This course builds upon the foundational knowledge presented in the Microsoft Outlook for Office 365™ (Desktop or Online): Part 1 course and will help students customize a communication system well-suited to their work style. This course covers the Microsoft Office Specialist Program exam objectives to help students prepare for the Outlook Associate (Office 365 and Office 2019): Exam MO-400 certification exam.
