## Objective
- Compare architecture and provisioning of resources in Teradata and BigQuery
- Configure datasets and tables in BigQuery
- Map and compare data types in Teradata to data types in BigQuery
- Map and optimize schemas from Teradata to BigQuery
- Translate SQL from Teradata to BigQuery

## Essentials
Experience using Teradata as a data warehouse for managing data and performing SQL analysis. Basic experience with BigQuery is recommended, but not required for this course.

## Audience
Data analysts, engineers, scientists, application developers, and more generally Teradata users who wish to transfer their skills and knowledge to BigQuery.

## Outline
Module 1: Understanding BigQuery Architecture


- Quick reminder of Teradata architecture
- Overview of BigQuery architecture
- Separation of compute and storage in BigQuery
- BigQuery Slots
- Workload management in BigQuery
Module 2: Creating Datasets and Tables in BigQuery


- Resource Hierarchy in Teradata
- Resource Hierarchy in BigQuery
- Creating resources in BigQuery
- Sharing resources in BigQuery
- Lab: Provisioning and Managing Resources in BigQuery
Module 3: Mapping Data Types from Teradata to BigQuery


- How data types map from Teradata to BigQuery
- Understand data types unique to BigQuery
Module 4: Schema Optimization and Mapping


- Schema definitions in BigQuery
- Partitioning in BigQuery
- Clustering in BigQuery
- Lab: Schema Migration to BigQuery
Module 5: SQL Translation from Teradata to BigQuery


- SELECT statements
- DML statements
- DDL statements
- UDFs and Procedures
- Lab: Writing SQL for BigQuery

## Summary
In this course you will learn how to translate various concepts in Teradata to the analogous concepts in BigQuery. You will learn how the high-level architectures of Teradata and BigQuery compare, understand differences in how to configure datasets and tables, map data types in Teradata to data types in BigQuery, understand schema mapping from Teradata to BigQuery, optimize your new schemas in BigQuery, and do a high-level comparison of SQL dialects in Teradata and BigQuery.
