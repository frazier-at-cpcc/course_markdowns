## Objective
- Learn modern tools for developing on the Salesforce Platform using Visual Studio Code, the Salesforce Extension Pack, and the Salesforce CLI.
- Write business logic customizations using Apex triggers and classes; those customizations will use SOQL and DML.
- Design programmatic solutions that take advantage of declarative customizations.
- Describe how your trigger code works within the basics of the Save Order of Execution.
- Describe some of the fundamental aspects of designing programs on a multi-tenant platform.
- Write Visualforce markup and code to customize the user interface.
- Use the built-in testing framework to test Apex and Visualforce.

## Essentials
Complete the Computer Set-up Guide for this class.

## Audience
This course is designed for programmatic developers looking to write programmatic customizations to both business logic and UI layers using Apex and Visualforce. You should have a good understanding of core object-oriented programming concepts and experience building declarative solutions on the Salesforce Platform. This course is also a great foundation builder if you're looking to earn your Salesforce Platform Developer I credential.

IMPORTANT: Students are expected to follow the steps detailed in the Computer Set-up Guide for this class if you'll be using your own computer when attending a virtual or in-person class.

## Summary
Learn how to customize and design applications programmatically on the Salesforce Platform. In this 5-day class, our platform experts will introduce you to Apex (Salesforce's programming language) and Visualforce markup, so you can customize your Salesforce applications using code and explore how Apex interacts with declarative customizations on the platform. Learn how to retrieve, manipulate, and store data programmatically in data objects (sObjects), write and test custom logic, write Visualforce pages to customize your user interface, and deploy your solutions to another environment. Get an overview of the declarative automation tools available on the platform and a brief introduction to the Lightning Component framework. Plus, explore the nuances of working on a multi-tenant platform so you can extend the platform to meet business demands.
