This OpenHack enables participants to establish and defend baseline security and compliance configurations for organizations using Microsoft cloud services. This will be done with Microsoft Security and Compliance tools and recommended security best-practices by working through challenges inspired from real-world scenarios.

During the “hacking” participants will focus on analyzing and remediating security configurations in a pre-configured Microsoft online organization. Additionally, participants will implement security and compliance policies to enforce regulations required by the company and mitigate any threats discovered during the assessment.

By the end of the OpenHack, participants will have gained the knowledge on how to better protect an organization that uses hybrid cloud organizations leveraging SaaS, IaaS and PaaS solutions. Participants will also gain experience creating policies and procedures to meet the compliance needs of an organization.
