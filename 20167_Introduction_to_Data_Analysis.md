FACTS or Feelings: Your Choice
As data becomes more widely available, businesses are finding more success in adopting a fact-based decision model rather than relying on traditional intuition alone. In this module, we examine more closely the two types of decision models businesses use as well as the benefits of the fact-based model. We cover the steps of the Rational Decision Model, a fact-based method for decision making.

Part 4: Fact-Based Decision-Making Process
The two types of Decision Models Businesses use
The Benefits of Fact-Based Decision Making
Rational Decision Model: Six- Step Method

Exercise: " Who's The Boss?"- Students are divided into groups and told to imagine that they are the CEO of their own company. They define a business-related decision that they need to make and then apply the steps of the Rational Decision Model to arrive at the final conclusion.      

'BIG DATA' ANATOMY
In this module, we revisit the Big Data trend with a more detailed focus. We begin by defining the buzzword-"BIG DATA", examining its core attributes, and outlining the factors that contribute to data being  'big'. We explore how businesses collect structured and unstructured data, and the challenges they face in storing and effectively using both types of data.

Part 5: Big Data Anatomy
The Attributes of Big Data
Definition of Big Data
The 4 V's of Big Data
Structured versus Unstructured Data
The Challenges of Big Data
Exercise: "Camp WoeBeData"- Students are asked to describe some of the big data challenges that their companies face and to outline what steps are being taken to address the problems.

GETTING TO KNOW YOUR DATA
In order to better understand how to analyze data, we first have to comprehend its depth. This requires drilling deep beneath the server it is located on and understanding its composition. Assume we are given a structured data set with labeled columns and completed rows. There are plenty of ways to summarize the story behind the data, but we cannot dive in without first getting to understand its fundamental structure. We begin by classifying the collected data as quantitative or qualitative. Then we further classify our column variables according to the way data is measured: nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio. It is only after understanding this classification that we are able to proceed to the next step of choosing the appropriate analysis techniques which correspond to nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio variables.

Part 6: Getting to Know Your Data
Data Types: Qualitative versus Quantitative
Taking a Closer Look: Data Measurement
Four Types of Data Variables
Definition  and  examples  of Nominal Variables: Name only
Definition and examples  of  Ordinal Variables: Order Matters
Definition and examples of Interval Variables
Definition and examples of Ratio Variables
Summary of Statistics/Operations  that can be performed on each type
Exercise:  "Marketing to Low Renters" - Students are told to put on their data analyst thinking caps. They have been employed as a junior data analyst for a Marketing Company whose goal is to make a marketing campaign for a client who plans on targeting the 'needy' population. Students are given a public housing data set and told to classify each variable according to its measurement.

DATA VISUALIZATION
A picture is worth a thousand words, and there definitely is no exception when it comes to summarizing data. This module is dedicated to highlighting the importance of visualizing data, and how the human eye depends on visual representation to get a quick sense of data relevance. Visual representation is the audience's first impression of the data and forms a crucial step in inviting and maintaining a genuine interest in a subject matter. We demonstrate how to create colorful, easy to understand tables, charts, and graphs that aid in helping us convey the story behind the data set being analyzed.

Part 7: The Fundamental Ways we use data Visualization techniques
The five ways we use data visualization techniques
Part 8: Displaying Tabular Data in Excel
How to create custom tables in Excel
How to Sort/Filter tabular data
How to create and manipulate pivot tables
Part 9: Using Charts and Graphs to Communicate Data
How to create Pie, Column, and Line charts using Excel
Communicating effectively using different chart types
How to choose the correct chart to display the correct data type
Exercise: "Table Mining"- Students develop tables to summarize trends in a data set related to Low Rent and Section 8 housing.

Exercise: "Charting Poverty"- Students develop charts and graphs to summarize the poor housing epidemic in a public housing data set.

NUMERICAL DATA SUMMARIES
Another way that data analysts summarize data is by providing a single number, or summary statistic, that has meaning. This module explores how the mean, median, and mode can be used to summarize the center of discrete and continuous grouped data. The range, standard deviation, and inter-quartile range measure the dispersion in the data set and provide information about how data points are spread.

Part 10: Using Numerical Descriptives to Summarize Data
Measures of Centrality: Mean, Median, Mode
Format of Data Values: Grouped Discrete and  Grouped Continuous
Formulas for the Mean
Examples: Applying 3M's to Grouped Discrete and Grouped Continuous Data
Measures of Spread: Standard Deviation, Range, Inter-quartile Range
Examples: Applying Measures of Spread to Grouped Discrete and Grouped Continuous Data
Exercise: "Faulty Wear"- Students use mean, median, and mode to summarize information about returns from a department store.

Exercise:"Faulty Wear: Take 2"- Students use measures of spread to summarize the distribution of faulty garments from a department store.

QUANTIFYING UNCERTAINTY
Probability is not only the most important data analysis foundation, but it is by far the strongest measure that businesses can use to quantify uncertainty. There are risky decisions that businesses encounter when investing in certain stocks and taking a chance on whether its value will rise. The insurance industry calculates the most probable life expectancy for the population and bases its rates on that uncertainty. There is an abundance of examples that illustrate why understanding probability benefits the business industry, so this module is designed to expose students to a solid understanding of the topic. We use simple, easy to understand examples to introduce students to traditional and conditional probability. Then we follow up with other business probability applications that involve relative frequency and expectation.

Part 11: Probability: Quantifying Uncertainty
Origin of Probability
Probability: Examples of Business Applications
The traditional definition of Probability
Simple Computation: The TopBottomFraction Method
How to calculate probabilities from contingency tables

Exercise: "Peck Up Your Speed"-Students analyze the relative frequency of workers'  typing speeds.

Exercise: "Rent Me"-Students calculate the expected value in order to assist the Callow Corporation in making an important decision regarding leasing computer equipment.

NORMALITY
If you look at the graph of your data and notice that it looks like a bell-shaped curve, it probably follows a normal distribution. The manufacturing industry, for example, measures volumes and weights of products. Data collected from these instances are normally distributed. In fact, if we take any process and calculate its mean value enough times, then its mean value is also normally distributed.  This module examines the famous 'Normal Distribution' and how it can be used to provide useful information about the probability of certain events.

Part 12: The Normal Distribution
Examples of Normally Distributed Data Variables
Characteristics of the Normal Distribution
Interpreting the  Empirical Rule
Components of the Normal Distribution: Probabilities and X values

Exercise: "Fill 'R' Up"- Students help a manufacturer use the normal distribution of volumes from a cup dispenser to calculate probabilities of certain events.

ASSOCIATION AND PREDICTION
If we have data measurements for at least two variables, it is natural to ask if there is some relationship between the two. This module takes a look at the two strongest measures of association, correlation, and regression, and explores how to use them to quantify the relationship.  It also examines how regression output can be used to predict future observations.

Part 13: Correlation and Regression
Definition of Correlation and Regression
The relationship between Correlation and Regression
Correlation Coefficient: Values
Examples of Correlation
