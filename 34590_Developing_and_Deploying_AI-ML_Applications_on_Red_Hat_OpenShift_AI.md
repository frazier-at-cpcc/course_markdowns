## Objective
Impact on the Organization

    Organizations collect and store vast amounts of information from multiple sources. With Red Hat OpenShift AI, organizations have a platform ready to analyze data, visualize trends and patterns, and predict future business outcomes by using machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms.

Impact on the Individual

    As a result of attending this course, you will understand the foundations of the Red Hat OpenShift AI architecture. You will be able to install Red Hat OpenShift AI, manage resource allocations, update components and manage users and their permissions. You will also be able to train, deploy and serve models, including hot to use Red Hat OpenShit AI to apply best practices in machine learning and data science. Finally you will be able to create, run, manage and troubleshoot data science pipelines.
