In this section we will explore the motivating factors for teams adopting Agile practices.  Further we will examine the various Agile methods and the principles and practices they embrace.  Agile success with real-world examples across many industries will be shared to highlight the benefits that Agile can bring to teams.  Finally, we will explore the power behind Agile teams and how they differ from traditional project teams.

Exercise: Understanding the Agile Team – in this exercise we will explore the unique factors of why Agile teams work and learn to recognize the key factors for successful Agile implementation.

Part 2: Agile Basics & Practices
In this section we will establish a foundation of the basic roles, artifacts and forums utilized by Agile teams.  Agile terminology will be reviewed and we will review the complete “process” or framework which Agile teams utilize to achieve success.  For many teams, Agile merely means having Daily Stand-up Meetings and conducting a Retrospective every two weeks…but this is far from truly being Agile.

Exercise: Transition to an iterative approach – teams will engage in a fun exercise that will highlight the benefits behind why iterations work.

Part 3: Becoming Agile
In this section, we will review the information you need to know to begin your journey to “Becoming Agile.”  Many organizations/teams try to implement Agile without knowing the roadblocks they will face and what it takes to become an Agile team.  In this section of the course, you will cover key focus areas to becoming successful with Agile: 


- The Top 10 Agile Myths How to “Become Agile”
- Ten Pitfalls when Implementing Agile Setting your Course Forward
Exercise: Working through Roadblocks - As with any implementation, the implementation process itself should not be a distraction.  So it is with the implementation of Agile in a development environment.  In order to achieve that desired state of agility, a plan is needed, team members must know what to expect, and how you plan to get there. This exercise will you understand the roadblocks you must faces – and how to address them – as you move forward with your Agile implementation.
