## Summary
The three-day, Veeam® Backup & Replication™ v12.1: Architecture and Design training course is focused on teaching IT professionals how to effectively architect a Veeam solution through attaining technical excellence following the Veeam Architecture Methodology used by Veeam’s own Solution Architects. During the three days, attendees will explore the goals of requirement gathering and infrastructure assessment and use that information to design Veeam solutions within team exercises. Attendees will analyze considerations when turning logical designs into physical designs and describe the obligations to the implementation team that will implement that design. Other topics covered will include security, governance and validation impacts when architecting a Veeam solution and how to build these into the overall design.

Attendees should expect to contribute to team exercises, present designs and defend decision making.
