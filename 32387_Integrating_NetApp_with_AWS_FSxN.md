## Summary
In this course you will learn how to deploy an instance with appropriate segmentation, security and user policies. You will also learn how to select the optimal AWS storage type to support both migrations and hybrid deployments to an AWS instance. The course will cover NetApp fundamentals including SnapMirror which will be used to support hybrid environments as well as migrations to AWS. This knowledge will serve as the foundation to then deploy Amazon FSxN in an AWS instance and integrate it with a NetApp cluster on-premises.
