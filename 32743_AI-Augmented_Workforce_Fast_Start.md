## Summary
This workshop introduces the key frameworks that support the practical adoption and implementation of AI services and covers the first phase of the AI Adoption Framework; functional-level AI solutions. Participants will learn to identify opportunities for AI that can be quickly implemented without disrupting existing processes or workflows, enabling fast wins and gaining experience with AI that will support the later phases of the FASt Framework. Participants will select and use a specific AI capability that supports an activity they currently perform so that they can experience first-hand the benefits of AI.
