## Summary
This course explores how to use Numba—the just-in-time, type-specializing Python function compiler—to accelerate Python programs to run on massively parallel NVIDIA GPUs. You’ll learn how to: · Use Numba to compile CUDA kernels from NumPy universal functions (ufuncs). Use Numba to create and launch custom CUDA kernels · Apply key GPU memory management techniques Upon completion, you’ll be able to use Numba to compile and launch CUDA kernels to accelerate your Python applications on NVIDIA GPUs.
