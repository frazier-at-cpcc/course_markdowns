- Save and restore objects, libraries, and the system
- Monitor job and history logs
- Diagnose a system problem
- Order, receive, and apply PTFs
- Perform all of these functions using a 5250 emulation session as well as IBM i Access Client Solutions and IBM Navigator for i

## Essentials
There are no prerequisites for this course.

## Audience
This course is intended for the person who has responsibility for daily system operations.
