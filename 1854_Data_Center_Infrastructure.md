## Objective
The information technology, initially to the automation of repetitive tasks of internal accounting dedicated, is now at the heart of the commercial or technical business throughout the world. Equipment manufacturers meet this new burden of data processing by the marketing of ever more powerful and consumer of energy computers. These equipments require entirely new computer rooms or data centres. Most of data centres don’t meet these new technologies and are daily taking risks, including the major risk which is the total shutdown. This training meets all the concerns generated by the weak infrastructures of data centres, and can prepare for any refurbishment or new design with the main objectives of sustainability, availability and reduced energy consumption by more and more expensive. 
This formation provides you the knowledge and skills related to data centres infrastructures, urbanization, the pooling of different systems implemented, and their operation.
