## Objective
This course is approximately 50% hands-on, combining expert lecture, real-world demonstrations and group discussions with machine-based practical labs and exercises.  Working in a hands-on learning environment led by our expert practitioner, attendees will learn advanced skills needed to:



- Leverage OS services
- Add enhancements to classes
- Code graphical interfaces for applications
- Understand advanced Python metaprogramming concepts
- Create easy-to-use and easy-to-maintain modules and packages
- Implement and run unit tests
- Create multithreaded and multi-process applications
- Interact with network services
- Design professional scripts
- Query databases
- Process XML, CSV, and JSON data
- Time Permitting: Working with more data types
- Tim Permitting: Using type hints if time permits

## Essentials
Basic incoming practical experience working with Python is required, along with a working, user-level knowledge of Unix/Linux, Mac, or Windows.  This course does not cover Python fundamentals.

Students should have practical skills equivalent to or should have received training in the following topic(s) as a pre-requisite:

## Summary
A core component of our Python Journey skills-immersion training series, Next Level Python (with Advanced Python Topics) is a highly-rated, hands-on training course that has provided thousands of students with the skills required to apply advanced Python to their daily programming needs. This course picks up where our foundational courses leave off, covering some topics in greater depth, adding many new ones, all with a focus on enterprise development.

Throughout the course, youâ€™ll gain hands-on experience with leveraging OS services, coding graphical interfaces for applications, creating modules and running unit tests, defining classes, interacting with network services, querying databases, processing XML data, and much more.  All concepts are reinforced by informal practice during the lecture, then followed by deeper lab exercises.
