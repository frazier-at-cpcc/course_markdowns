## Objective
This course is approximately 50% hands-on, combining expert lecture, real-world demonstrations and group discussions with machine-based practical labs and exercises. Working in a hands-on learning environment led by our expert practitioner attendees will explore how to:


- Describe Ansible concepts and install Red Hat Ansible Engine (optional – we can pre-install is as well if desired, depending on the audience)
- Deploy Ansible and Configure Ansible to manage hosts and run ad hoc Ansible commands.
- Implement playbooks
- Write a simple Ansible playbook and run it to automate tasks on multiple managed hosts.
- Manage variables and facts
- Write playbooks that use variables to simplify management of the playbook and facts to reference information about managed hosts.
- Implement task control; Manage task control, handlers, and task errors in Ansible playbooks.
- Deploy files to managed hosts
- Deploy, manage, and adjust files on hosts managed by Ansible.
- Manage large projects
- Write playbooks that are optimized for larger, more complex projects.
- Simplify playbooks with roles
- Use Ansible roles to develop playbooks more quickly and to reuse Ansible code.
- Troubleshoot Ansible
- Troubleshoot playbooks and managed hosts.
- Automate Linux administration tasks
- Automate common Linux system administration tasks with Ansible.

## Essentials
Attendees should have incoming experience similar to the topics listed in the course(s) below or should have attended these as a pre-requisite:


- TTPS4800 Introduction to Python Programming Basics – 3 days
