## Summary
Great feedback from a Head of IT at The British Red Cross:

"The team undoubtedly felt that the course was much better than the traditional approach and really appreciated the difference, reporting they felt more engaged, enjoyed it more, and took a lot away from it. They all really appreciated having more time to play and experiment rather than the crammed/condensed timeframe of the traditional training (this was reflected in the comments of those who attended the traditional alternative – feeling too rushed and didn’t really have the opportunity to absorb what they were being told).”
