## Summary
This course helps architects to gain the skills required to design an HPE Aruba Networking Data Center switching solution. An architect is an IT professional proficient in interpreting technical requirements to create and design secure, redundant, scalable, resilient, or high-performing infrastructure-consistent with appropriate validated solution guide per business needs. Architects are able to interpret complex requirements and constraints to design an optimal HPE Aruba Networking solution.

Candidates for this course have vast technical knowledge of HPE Aruba Networking solutions and can articulate their business value to multiple stakeholders. These solutions may require a migration and/or deployment strategy from/into an existing architecture. They need to understand the design implications of third-party interoperability (hardware/software). Additionally, candidates will have extensive experience building solutions and optimizing applications and workloads.
