## Objective
Students who attend Secure Software Design will leave the course armed with the skills required to recognize software vulnerabilities (actual and potential) and design defenses for those vulnerabilities. This course quickly introduces developers to the various types of threats against their software.  The concept and process of Threat Modeling is introduced as a key enabler for architecting effective and appropriate security for software and information assets.

Our engaging instructors and mentors are highly experienced practitioners who bring years of current "on-the-job" experience into every classroom. Guided by our expert team, attendees will learn to:



- Understand the concepts and terminology behind defensive coding
- Learn the entire spectrum of threats and attacks that take place against software applications in today's world
- Recognize and characterize existing and planned defensive controls
- Relate controls and activities to the phases of a typical exploit
- Understand and implement the processes and measures associated with the security development lifecycle (SDL)
- Identify appropriate security objectives and regulations including evolving privacy considerations
- Develop a list of risk escalators as well as potential mitigations based on an understanding of vulnerabilities
- Recognize design features that can significantly increase an applicationâ€™s attack surface
- Build an asset inventory and begin the process of prioritizing their value
- Work with a baseline asset inventory to develop an initial asset inventory for a software application
- Understand and apply defensive options to data assets
- Perform attack surface analysis and associated mitigations
- Identify the need for defensive measures on data flows that cross trust boundaries
- Understand and use Threat Modeling as a tool in identifying software vulnerabilities based on realistic threats against meaningful assets
- Use Threat Modeling to identify potential vulnerabilities in a real-life case study
- Perform a category-based vulnerability analysis to help ensure that any gaps are identified

## Summary
Secure Software Design is an intensive, hands-on security training course, essential for experienced software designers and architects who need to engineer secure enterprise-supported web applications. In addition to teaching basic vulnerabilities, this course digs deep into sound processes and practices that apply to the entire software development lifecycle. 

In this course, students thoroughly examine issues and risks associated with web applications, including XML processing, rich interfaces, and both RESTful and SOAP-based web services.  Students will repeatedly attack and then understand the tactical and strategic defensive measure for various assets associated with fully functional web applications and web services.  This hands-on approach drives home the mechanics of how to secure web applications in the most practical of terms.

Security is costly, and this course focuses both on how to effectively use resources and where to apply those resources. During the course, students are presented with a list of actionable items to fully leverage the results of applying secure practices. Attack phases and types of defensive controls are related to the activities that the students participate in during the lab and group activities. Students will develop an understanding of the importance of defaulting to a secure position and deviating from that as is appropriate. The rationale for deviating from the most secure position is based on understanding risk and threats.

Security experts agree that the least effective approach to security is "penetrate and patch".  It is far more effective to "bake" security into an application throughout its lifecycle.  After spending significant time trying to defend a poorly designed (from a security perspective) web application, developers are ready to learn how to build secure web applications starting at project inception.  The final portion of this course builds on the previously learned mechanics for building defenses by exploring how design and analysis can be used to build stronger applications from the beginning of the software lifecycle.
