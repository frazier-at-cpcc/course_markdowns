## Summary
This training teaches you how to install, operate, configure, and verify a basic IPv4 and IPv6 network, configure network components, such as switches, routers, and wireless local area network (LAN) controllers (WLNs), manage network devices, and identify basic security threats. This training also covers the introduction of AI and machine learning (ML) in network operations. 

Please note that this course is a combination of Instructor-Led and Self-Paced Study - 5 days in the classroom and approx 3 days of self study. The self-study content will be provided as part of the digital courseware that you recieve at the beginning of the course and should be part of your preparation for the exam. Lab access is provided for both the class and the self- study sections, lab access is valid for 60 hours or 90 days whichever is the shorter, so please ensure you exit the lab exercises when not in use.

This Learning Path prepares you for the Cisco Certified Network Associate (200-301 CCNA) v1.1 exam. If passed, you earn your Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA).
