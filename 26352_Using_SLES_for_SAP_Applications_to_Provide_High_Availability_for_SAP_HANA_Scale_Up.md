## Objective
Attendees will be taught the following concepts and skills:


- Introduction to SAP HANA
- Understand the SAP HANA high availability component System Replication
- Plan for, install and configure SAP HANA with System Replication
- Tune the SLE cluster nodes to host SAP HANA
- Deploy and configure SLE HA to host SAP HANA SR with automated SAP HANA failover
- Design and perform cluster tests
- Monitor SAP HANA SR and perform cluster administration tasks specific to the configuration

## Essentials
Attendees should have  knowledge of SLES equivalent to the SCA in Enterprise Linux level.  A detailed understanding of the SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension or general High Availability concepts is required. Knowledge of SAP HANA including System Replication would be beneficial.

## Audience
SLES administrators tasked with administering SLE HA clusters hosting SAP HANA SR in a Scale Up Performance Optimized configuration.

## Summary
This course provides an understanding of the tasks and processes involved in deploying SAP HANA with System Replication in a Scale Up Performance Optimized configuration on SLES for SAP Applications with HA. This course is based on SUSE best practices. The course starts by providing an overview of SAP HANA and using System Replication (SR) to provide high availability for SAP HANA. It then covers the storage and configuration required to successfully deploy SAP HANA SR on SLE High Availability (HA). Next the required cluster resources are configured and tested. The course finishes by discussing administration procedures specific to the configuration then the SLE cluster nodes are tuned specifically to host SAP HANA.
