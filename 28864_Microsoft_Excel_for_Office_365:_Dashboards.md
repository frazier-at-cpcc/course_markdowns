## Summary
Today's world runs on data more than ever before and that's a trend not likely to change, or even slow down, any time soon. With the tremendous amount of available data, the ability to make sense of it continues to be an ongoing challenge. Students already know how to use Excel to perform simple calculations and modify worksheets to make them easier to read, interpret, and present to others. But Excel is capable of doing so much more. 

To gain a truly competitive edge, students need to be able to extract actionable organizational intelligence from their raw data, and present it in a visually compelling format that enables decision makers to view key trends and gain insights. And that's exactly what this course aims to help students do. 

This course builds upon the foundational knowledge presented in the Microsoft Excel for Office 365 (Desktop or Online): Part 1 course and introduces the basics of data analysis and how to use Excel to create informative dashboards.
