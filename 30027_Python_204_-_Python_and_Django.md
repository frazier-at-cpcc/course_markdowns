## Summary
Geared for experienced web developers new to Python, Introduction to Full Stack Web Development with Python and Django is a five-day hands-on course that teaches students how to develop Web applications using the Django framework. Students will explore the basics of creating basic applications using the MVC (model-view-controller) design pattern, as well as more advanced topics such as administration, session management, authentication, and automated testing. This comprehensive, practical course provides an in-depth exploration of working with the programming language, not an academic overview of syntax and grammar.  Students will immediately be able to use Python to complete tasks in the real world.
