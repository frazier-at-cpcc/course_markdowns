## Summary
This four-day course is designed to provide students with the background knowledge required to work with the Juniper Cloud products. Students will gain in-depth knowledge of how to use Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machines (KVM), Red Hat OpenStack Platform, Docker, Kubernetes, and Red Hat OpenShift. Through demonstrations and hands-on labs, students will gain experience with the features of each of these technologies. It should be noted that this course does not cover Contrail Networking. This course is based on Red Hat Linux version 7.8, RHOSP version 13, Docker version 3:19.03.12-3.el7, Kubernetes version 1.18.6-0, and Red Hat OpenShift version 3.11.
