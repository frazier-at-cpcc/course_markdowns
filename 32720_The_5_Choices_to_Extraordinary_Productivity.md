## Summary
The 5 Choices to Extraordinary Productivity® course is based on ideas and practices accumulated over decades from the leaders of productivity. This FranklinCovey seminar provided by AMA will help you develop the necessary tools to maximize productivity in the workplace.

For most of us, the demands our careers sometimes place on our shoulders can be overwhelming. Combine this with the distractions caused by an unending influx of information, and our lives can become downright exhausting. If we don’t react to these stimuli with clear discernment, our ability to think clearly and make wise decisions about what’s important suffers—and the goals that matter most in our professional and personal lives get shortchanged, or worse, not accomplished at all.

This productivity seminar combines current neuroscience research with proven productivity principles to help you better manage your decisions, attention, and energy. You’ll learn how to apply a process—which incorporates the use of Microsoft Outlook®—to dramatically increase your ability to achieve life’s most important outcomes by consistently making choices that create extraordinary value for yourself and your organization. This solution not only produces a measurable increase in productivity but can also provide you with a renewed sense of engagement and accomplishment.
