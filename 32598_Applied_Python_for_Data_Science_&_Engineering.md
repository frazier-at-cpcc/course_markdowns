## Objective
This course is approximately 50% hands-on, combining expert lecture, real-world demonstrations and group discussions with machine-based practical labs and exercises.  Our engaging instructors and mentors are highly experienced practitioners who bring years of current "on-the-job" experience into every classroom.  Working in a hands-on learning environment, guided by our expert team, attendees will learn how to:



- Learn essentials Python scripting methods to create and run basic programs
- Design and code modules and classes
- Implement and run unit tests
- Use benchmarks and profiling to speed up programs
- Process XML, JSON, and CSV
- Manipulate arrays with NumPy
- Get a grasp of the diversity of subpackages that make up SciPy
- Use Series and Dataframes with Pandas
- Use Jupyter notebooks for ad hoc calculations, plots, and what-if?

## Essentials
While there are no specific programming prerequisites, students should be comfortable working with files and folders and the command line. Prior scripting experience is helpful but not required.

## Audience
This course is geared for data analysts, developers, engineers or anyone tasked with utilizing Python for data analytics tasks.
