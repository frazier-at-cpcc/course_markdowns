## Summary
The Internet of Things (IoT) enables data to be collected and analyzed on a massive scale, enabling well-informed decisions to be made quickly. However, the deluge of data handled by IoT systems is often acquired, processed, and presented using new technologies that are rapidly evolving and in some cases being rushed to market, creating new concerns for data privacy and cybersecurity.

Securing IoT systems can be a complicated proposition, involving hazards that many IT workers have never had to deal with. Solutions may involve resource-constrained IoT devices and technologies from many different vendors. IoT devices may be installed in vulnerable locations, and new network devices and protocols add complexity to the overall network architecture.
