## Summary
These days, most people take electronic word processing for granted. While we may still write out our grocery lists with pen and paper, we expect to use a computer to create the majority of our documents. It's impossible to avoid word-processing software in many areas of the business world. Managers, lawyers, clerks, reporters, and editors rely on this software to do their jobs. Whether students are an executive secretary or a website designer, they will need to know the ins and outs of electronic word processing. 

Microsoft Word is designed to help users move smoothly through the task of creating professional looking documents. Its rich features and powerful tools can make their work easy, and even fun.  

In this course, students will learn how to use Word on the desktop to create and edit simple documents; format documents; add tables and lists; add design elements and layout options; and proof documents. Note: Most Office 365 users perform the majority of their daily tasks using the desktop version of the Office software, so that is the focus of this training. The course material will also enable students to access and effectively utilize many web-based resources provided with their Office 365 subscription. This includes brief coverage of key skills for using Word for the Web and OneDrive. Helpful notes throughout the material alert students to cases where the online version of the application may function differently from the primary, desktop version. 

This course covers Microsoft Office Specialist Program exam objectives to help students prepare for the Word Associate (Office 365 and Office 2019): Exam MO-100 and Word Expert (Office 365 and Office 2019): Exam MO-101 certification exams.
