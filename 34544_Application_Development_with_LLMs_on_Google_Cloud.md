## Summary
In this course, you explore tools and APIs available on Google Cloud for integrating large language models (LLMs) into your application. After exploring generative AI options on Google Cloud, next you explore LLMs and prompt design in Vertex AI Studio. Then you learn about LangChain, an open-source framework for developing applications powered by language models. After a discussion around more advanced prompt engineering techniques, you put it all together to build a multi-turn chat application by using LangChain and the Vertex AI PaLM API.
