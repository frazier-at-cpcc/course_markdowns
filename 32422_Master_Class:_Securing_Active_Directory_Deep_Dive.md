## Objective
In this master class course, the topic of Active Directory security is taken centrally into focus - in the meantime, various attack scenarios are known, which were used, for example, in the Bundestag hack ( mimikatz et.al. ).

These valid attack scenarios are aimed at credential theft or ransomware implementation (e.g. at the logistics company Maersk with an estimated damage of 300 million euros).

The goal of this workshop is to understand these scenarios so that you can prevent them and implement an Active Directory implementation that resists these attacks and is hardened against future attacks.

The Active Directory are your "crown jewels" - without Active Directory, most corporate environments are completely crippled productively.

That's why: Understand, harden and monitor so you can sleep better.

## Essentials
At least 5 years of experience with Active Directory and client systems.

## Audience
This course is designed for experienced system administrators, consultants and Active Directory designers. After this seminar, you will be able to design, implement and consult on highly secure Active Directory.
