Introduction to Conversational AI	



- Explore the conversational AI landscape and gain a deeper understanding of the key components of ASR pipelines:
- Work through an ASR model example from audio to spectrogram to text.
- Explore decoders, customizations, and additional models, including inverse text normalization (ITN), punctuation and capitalization, and language identification.
- Deploy Riva ASR.
Customized Conversational AI Pipelines	



- Explore the key components of the TTS pipeline and full pipeline customizations:
- Explore the spectrogram generator model and the vocoder model.
- Work with text normalization and grapheme to phoneme (G2P) conversion to customize pronunciations.
- Deploy a full ASR-NLP-TTS custom pipeline in Riva.
Inference and Deployment Challenges	



- Explore challenges related to performance, optimization, and scaling in production deployment of conversational AI applications:
- Gain an understanding of the inference deployment process.
- Analyze non-functional requirements and their implications.
- Use a Helm chart to deploy a conversational AI application with a Kubernetes cluster.
Final Review
