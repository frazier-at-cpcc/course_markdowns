## Summary
'Cisco U. All Access' is Cisco's new digital learning product that replaces the previous Cisco Digital Learning Subscription: All Inclusive.

All Access includes everything included in 'Cisco U. Essentials', plus the entire catalog of training content. There is no longer any pricing for content, because with Cisco U. All Access, you have access to everything. Your team has access to the entire Cisco U. catalog of product content, role training, and certification preparation. Every learning path and course is included in All Access.

Cisco U. is a new technical learning experience tailored to your team's learning needs to help you get the highest return on your Cisco technology investment and achieve faster business results.

How does Cisco U. accomplish this? By consistently focusing on the individual learner, whether they need in-the-moment learning to address day-to-day situations or a deeper immersion in learning for job roles, solutions, and certification preparation.

Cisco U. meets your team's learning needs by following three guiding principles:


- Guidance, meaning Cisco U. will guide them to content that is best for them,
- Community, so they can collaborate with colleagues and Cisco experts,
- and Depth, meaning the quality and richness of the content.
