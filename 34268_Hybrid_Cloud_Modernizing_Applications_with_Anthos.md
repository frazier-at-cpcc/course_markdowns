## Summary
This fourth course of the Architecting Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure with Anthos series equips students to consider multiple approaches for modernizing applications and services within Anthos environments. Approaches include optimizing workloads on serverless platforms in Google Cloud and on VMware, and migrating workloads onto the Anthos platform. This course is a continuation of the Anthos on Bare Metal course and assumes direct experience in operating Anthos clusters from that course.
