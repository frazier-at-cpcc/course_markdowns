## Summary
This workshop covers the third phase of the AI Adoption Framework; system-level AI solutions. Participants will learn to identify opportunities for AI that can be implemented by reimagining an entire system consisting of multiple work domains. This is the third step to using AI to design how entire systems can be reworked to embrace the capabilities of AI.  Multiple work domains will be examined and opportunities to modify them substantially using AI will be explored. For example the Go To Market system typically consists of product/services, marketing, sales, channel/distribution, customer success, legal, finance, IT, and partners.  AI presents an opportunity to rethink this entire system. Participants will explore the system level changes that are possible with AI and set the stage for reimagining entire companies and markets.
