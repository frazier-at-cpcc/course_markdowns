## Summary
This one-day course is designed to provide in-depth instruction on segment routing, or Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING). The course focuses on the configuration of Juniper Networks routing and switching devices to support segment routing using MPLS switching. Topics include functional concepts, the configuration of the IGPs used to propagate label information within a domain, segment routing traffic engineering using BGP colored routes, and redundancy/high availability concepts including BFD, Topology Independent Loop-Free Alternative (TI-LFA), Anycast Segments, and the implementation of link aggregation in a segment routing design.
