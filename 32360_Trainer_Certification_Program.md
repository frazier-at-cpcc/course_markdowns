## Essentials
Diagnostic Evaluation
Before a trainee can attend this course, they must go through a diagnostic evaluation. Each trainee must submit a recorded video of themself delivering a class. This video must be submitted one week before the course start date, so the instructor has enough time to evaluate them prior to class. 

This video must have the following:


•	Topic to be chosen by the trainer: it is essential that the class is aimed at students with no prior knowledge of the topic.
•	The duration of the video must be between 5-7 minutes.
•	The trainee must appear on a camera for the entire duration of the video.
•	The video format must be MP4.
The trainee will receive their diagnostic evaluation on the first day of class so they can target areas of improvement during the course.

Capstone/Final Evaluation: 
Each trainee is required to conduct a final presentation on the last day of class.  Each presentation will be 20 minutes (15-minute delivery and 5 minutes of feedback from the instructor). We encourage trainees to review their diagnostic video submissions and incorporate any feedback/tips that they have learned throughout the course.  

Face-to-face feedback in class will be limited to the instructor pointing out strengths of the trainee, as well as their main areas of improvement.   

One week after completing the course, trainees will receive an evaluation rubric of their final presentation with descriptors of their performance, as well as some suggestions on how they can improve. The evaluation will inform the trainee if they have passed or failed their presentation. 

If the trainee fails their first evaluation, they can reschedule another evaluation after 2 weeks to ensure there is enough time to incorporate feedback that was provided in the evaluation. If they fail a second time, they must wait 2 months to reschedule.
