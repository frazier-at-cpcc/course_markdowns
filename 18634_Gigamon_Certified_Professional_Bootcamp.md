## Objective
A specialist providing network visibility must have a basic level of knowledge in four major categories in order to assist and advise management and the various network and security tool operators in how to provide complete and trustworthy network traffic and flow summary data to meet the organization’s monitoring and security needs. This course focuses on Gigamon products, basic networking, security, and cloud as they relate to network visibility solutions. The course provides instruction in support of the following:



- Understand approaches and considerations for out-of-band packet access
- How to select a trustworthy traffic source
- How to implement a packet access solution in a physical network infrastructure
- Methods and options for matching traffic volume with tool capacity
- How to implement packet optimization for analysis
- Connectivity requirements for inline and out-of-band tools
- Approaches and considerations for packet access for inline tools
- How to replicate traffic to out-of-band tools for augmenting inline security
- How to implement tool groupings and load sharing for inline processing
- Traffic sizing for inline security and network analysis tools
- Approaches and considerations for packet access in the cloud
- How to implement a packet access solution in a cloud or hybrid network infrastructure
- How to extract virtualized traffic for use with virtualized and physical tools
- How to perform visibility solution maintenance and operations

## Essentials
