## Summary
In the past, popular thought treated artificial intelligence (AI) as if it were the domain of science fiction or some far-flung future. In the last few years, however, AI has been given new life. The business world has especially given it renewed interest. However, AI is not just another technology or process for the business to consider—it is a truly disruptive force, one that promises to deliver an entirely new level of results for all aspects of the business. Even organizations that resist adopting AI will feel its impact. If the organization wants to thrive and survive in this transforming business landscape, it will need to harness the power of AI.

Despite its promises, AI can seem like a daunting concept for business professionals. How can you hope to apply AI to your own business if you can't see beyond the vague buzzwords and hype? That's why this course was created: to give you the essential knowledge of AI you'll need to steer the business forward.
