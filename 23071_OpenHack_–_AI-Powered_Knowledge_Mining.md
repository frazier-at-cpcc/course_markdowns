## Objective
By the end of the OpenHack, attendees will have built out a technical solution that is a complete Azure machine learning-based intelligent search infrastructure that can make sense of vast quantities of data (i.e. documents, scanned images, and other digital artifacts).



- AI-Powered Knowledge Mining helps businesses make better decisions through more robust data extraction and analysis
- Improved search functionality to decrease time-to-find relevant data

## Essentials
To be successful and get the most out of this OpenHack, it is highly recommended that participants have previous experience with:
 
Tooling Prerequisites
To avoid any delays with downloading or installing tooling, have the following ready to go ahead of the OpenHack: 



- A modern laptop running Windows 10 (1703 or higher), Mac OSX (10.12 or higher), or one of these Ubuntu versions
- Install your choice of Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software, such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or IntelliJ [/lnik]. The recommended IDE is Visual Studio Code.
- After installing Visual Studio Code, install the following language-specific extensions for the language you plan to use:




C#

- NET Core SDK
- C# Extension for Visual Studio Code


JavaScript

- Node.js

Python

- Python Extension for Visual Studio Code

- After installing the language-specific extensions, install the Azure Functions extension. You will use this in some of the later challenges.

- Most of the operations to create and modify Azure Search entities involve submitting JSON requests to a REST interface. You can write code in your preferred language to do this, or you can use Postman to create and submit collections of REST requests.

Language-Specific Prerequisites



- Recommended that participants have previous experience with knowledge of programing languages including C#, JavaScript, Node.JS or Java.

## Audience
- App Developers
- ML/AI Engineers
- Customers looking to extract insights from vast quantities of diverse data
- Customers looking for intuitive search capabilities to help them find and make sense of relevant information that they need to make key business decisions
