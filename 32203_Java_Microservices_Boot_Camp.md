## Objective
This course provides a solid understanding of what microservices bring to the table and how to facilitate the implementation, deployment, and management of microservices using Java’s JAX-RS framework. Working within in a hands-on learning environment, guided by our expert team, attendees will learn to:



- Understand the why and how of basic microservices
- Understand the relationships between microservices and SOA, SOAP services, and other recent initiatives.
- Understand the steps involved in the development of Microservices
- Examine the ecosystem that surrounds and supports microservices, including a typical stack, monitoring, logging, containerizing, deploying and orchestrating microservices
- Work with implemented microservices to package, deploy, and manage them.
- Understand and work with the Cloud to scale microservices
- Containerize microservices using Docker
- Recognize and use best practices relative to designing and working with microservices
- Understand and apply the basic concepts of REST
- Understand and intelligently discuss the similarities and differences between RESTful services and SOAP-based services
- Appreciate the security concerns associated with RESTful services
- Design, develop, and deploy real-world RESTful Services
- Implement RESTful services using JAX-RS to
- Implement RESTful Java clients
- Implement JAX-RS Filters and Interceptors
- Design and implement asynchronous JAX-RS processing
- If time permits, there is also coverage of OAuth and OpenID

## Essentials
Incoming students should have skills equivalent to those in this course, or should have taken this course:



- Fast Track to Java 11 Programming for OO Experienced Developers (C#, C++, etc.) (TT2104-J11)
- Fast Track to Core Java 8 Programming for OO Experienced Developers

## Audience
This is an intermediate level training course, designed for experienced Java developers and architects who need to identify, design, and implement web services. We will explore and apply the terminology, the specification, the processes and technologies specific to web services.  Students should have at least a year of practical development experience with Java and servlets, and should be familiar with XML and JSON.

## Summary
Geared for experienced Java developers, Java Microservices Boot Camp is a three day, lab-intensive services training course that introduces developers to the core concepts, principles, and Java implementations for microservices. Microservices continues the evolution of systems and applications being decomposed into smaller components that work together to accomplish larger business tasks and services. Microservices are single purpose, autonomous, and independently deployable.
