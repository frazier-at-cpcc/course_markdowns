## Essentials
Students should have intermediate-level networking knowledge and an understanding of OSPF, IS-IS,BGP, and Junos policy. Students should have experience configuring MPLS label-switched paths using Junos. Students should also attend the Introduction to the Operating System (IJOS), JUNOS Intermediate Routing (JIR) and the Junos MPLS Fundamentals (JMF) courses prior to attending this class.

## Audience
This course benefits individuals responsible for configuring and monitoring devices running the Junos OS.
