## Objective
This course combines expert lecture, real-world demonstrations and group discussions with machine-based practical labs and exercises.  Our engaging instructors and mentors are highly experienced practitioners who bring years of current "on-the-job" experience into every classroom.  

Working in a hands-on learning environment led by our expert practitioner attendees will learn how to:



- Secure and automate techniques to protect web, mobile or cloud services
- Automate secure code inspection in C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript
- Automate secure code inspection with open source tools and effective secure code scanning suggestions
- Apply security testing tools and automation frameworks to identify security vulnerabilities in web, mobile and cloud services
- Integrate security testing tools such as OWASP ZAP, NMAP, SSLyze, SQLMap, and OpenSCAP
- Integrate security testing with automation frameworks like fuzz, BDD, Selenium and Robot Framework
- Implement automation testing techniques with Selenium, JMeter, Robot Framework, Gauntlt, BDD, DDT, and Python unittest
- Execute security testing of a Rest API Implement web application security with open source tools and script templates for CI/CD integration
- Integrate various types of security testing tool results from a single project into one dashboard

## Essentials
To be successful in this course, attendees should possess these skills:



- Basic to Intermediate IT Skills.
- Basic Python scripting skills. Attendees without a programming background like Python may view labs as follow along exercises or team with others to complete them.
- Good foundational mathematics or logic skills
- Basic Linux skills, including familiarity with command-line options such as ls, cd, cp, and su

## Summary
Security automation is the automatic handling of software security assessments tasks. Introduction to DevSecOps is a comprehensive hands-on course designed to provide you with the skills needed to help you build your security automation framework to scan for vulnerabilities without human intervention. This course will teach you to adopt security automation techniques to continuously improve your entire software development and security testing, learning about and working with open source tools and techniques to integrate security testing tools directly into your CI/CD framework.  

Throughout this course, you will see how to implement security inspection at every layer, such as secure code inspection, fuzz testing, Rest API, privacy, infrastructure security, and web UI testing. With the help of practical examples, this course will teach you to implement the combination of automation and Security in DevOps. You will learn about the integration of security testing results for an overall security status for projects. By the end of this course, you will be confident implementing automation security in all layers of your software development stages and will be able to build your own in-house security automation platform throughout your mobile and cloud releases.
