## Summary
Your application written in any programming language works as intended, so you are done, right? But did you consider feeding in incorrect values? 16Gbs of data? A null? An apostrophe? Negative numbers, or specifically -1 or -2^31? Because that’s what the bad guys will do – and the list is far from complete.

PCI DSS is a mandatory security standard for all companies developing or working with systems that handle credit cards. It does not only require following the secure coding guidelines out there, but also requires developers to train themselves on the latest best practices. But ticking the box annually is not enough.

Handling security needs a healthy level of paranoia, and this is what this course provides: a strong emotional engagement by lots of hands-on labs and stories from real life, all to substantially improve code hygiene. Mistakes, consequences, and best practices are our blood, sweat and tears.

The curriculum goes through the common Web application security issues following the OWASP Top Ten but goes far beyond it both in coverage and the details.All this is put in the context of Java, and extended by core programming issues, discussing security pitfalls of the Java language.

So that you are prepared for the forces of the dark side.

So that nothing unexpected happens.

Nothing.

Note: This course is customized for PCI DSS requirement 6.3 compliance, concerning both the content and the delivery structure.

The course covers essential secure coding skills that are a must for all developers working with cardholder data and brings in a number of case studies from the financial sector.

Aligned to the compliance requirements, the delivery of the training days can be done separately, breaking the course into two separate events that can span across year boundaries, aligned to your long-term compliance plans.

Important: delivery of the 1-day initial plenary session can only be organized bundled (having at least two sessions batched).
