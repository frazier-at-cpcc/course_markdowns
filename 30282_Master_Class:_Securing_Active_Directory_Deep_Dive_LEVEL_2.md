Want to make your crown jewels even more secure?

Is your environment critical or are you in the "SupplyChain"?

Or are you even bound to secrecy?

No problem: We will show you how to secure your environment extremely.

After more than 100 trainings in this area, this course was created as a worthy successor to the well-known and highly booked MasterClass Active Directory Security.

That's why: Understand, harden and monitor so you can sleep better.

Prior attendance of the Master Class: Securing Active Directory Deep Dive (SADDD-L1) course is REQUIRED AND must be verified.

## Summary
In this follow-up to the Master Class Active Directory Security, you will learn everything that could not be discussed in the first course due to time and know-how constraints.

We have added another "spurt" of security topics.

Look forward to a worthy successor to our Master Class Active Directory Security.

Please note:

You can only participate in this follow-up course if you have previously attended the Master Class Active Directory Security with Andy Wendel as trainer.

In the first MasterClass Active Directory Security course, we already covered the most important topics for securing your Active Directory.

Over the last few years, the questions for even deeper topics and approaches have become louder and louder in our courses.

Here comes our answer.

Three days of intensive Active Directory security topics.

Look forward to the successor.

We promise: Our best know-how for you and your day-to-day work from our most experienced trainers and consultants.
