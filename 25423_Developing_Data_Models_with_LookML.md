## Objective
- Define LookML basic terms and building blocks
- Modify LookML projects using the Looker Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and project version control
- Create dimensions and measures to curate data attributes used by business users
- Create and design Explores to make data accessible to business users
- Create new tables instantaneously using derived tables
- Optimize SQL query performance using caching and datagroups in Looker

## Essentials
To get the most out of this course, participants should have a basic understanding of SQL, Git, and the Looker business user experience. For learners with no previous experience as data explorers in Looker, it is recommended to first complete Analyzing and Visualizing Data in Looker.

## Audience
This course is primarily intended for the following participants:



- Data developers who are responsible for data curation and management within their organizations.
