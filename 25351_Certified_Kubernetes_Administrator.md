## Objective
In this course, students will learn and practice essential Kubernetes concepts and tasks in the following sections: 



- 1. Cluster Architecture, Installation & Configuration 
Each student will be given an environment that allows them to build a Kubernetes cluster from scratch. After a detailed discussion on key architectural components and primitives, students will install and compare two production grade Kubernetes clusters.
- 2. Review: Kubernetes Fundamentals 
After successfully instantiating their own Kubernetes Cluster, students will be guided through foundational concepts of deploying and managing applications in a production environment.
- 3. Workloads & Scheduling 
After establishing a solid Kubernetes command line foundation, students will be led through discussion and hands-on labs which focus on effectively creating applications that are easy to configure, simple to manage, quick to scale, and able to heal themselves.
- 4. Services & Networking 
Thoroughly understanding the underlying physical and network infrastructure of a Kubernetes cluster is an essential skill for a Certified Kubernetes Administrator. After an in-depth discussion of the Kubernetes Networking Model, students explore the networking of their clusterâ€™s Control Plane, Workers, Pods, and Services.
- 5. Storage 
Certified Kubernetes Administrators are often in charge of designing and implementing the storage architecture for their clusters. After discussing many common cluster storage solutions and how to best use each, students practice incorporating stateful storage into their applications.
- 6. Troubleshooting 
A Certified Kubernetes Administrator is expected to be an effective troubleshooter for their cluster. The lecture covers a variety of ways to evaluate and optimize available log information for efficient troubleshooting, and the labs have students practice diagnosing and resolving several typical issues within their Kubernetes Cluster.
- 7. Certified Kubernetes Administrator Practice Exam 
Just like the Cloud Native Computing Foundation CKA Exam, the students will be given two hours to complete hands-on tasks in their own Kubernetes environment. Unlike the certification exam, students taking the Alta3 CKA Practice Exam will have scoring and documented answers available immediately after the exam is complete, and will have built-in class time to re-examine topics that they wish to discuss in greater depth.

## Essentials
This course is intended for students who have the basic knowledge of the core components of Kubernetes, such as Pods and Deployments.
