## Objective
Throughout the course you’ll learn how to:



- Gain a solid understanding of the Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) lifecycle, including its purpose, key elements, and how it differs from related fields like DevOps and DataOps.
- Develop practical skills in using key MLOps tools and techniques, such as setting up an MLOps environment using MLflow and Kubeflow, and working through a basic machine learning pipeline.
- Master the art of automating machine learning workflows to streamline and improve the efficiency of your machine learning projects.
- Familiarize yourself with the AI Security landscape, including threat identification and application of best practices for securing machine learning environments.
- Dive deep into advanced AI Security concepts, including understanding and implementing differential privacy in machine learning models and defending against adversarial attacks.
- Learn to balance technical implementation with ethical considerations, developing a well-rounded approach to AI Security that respects privacy concerns and adheres to ethical guidelines.

## Essentials
To ensure a smooth learning experience and maximize the benefits of attending this course, you should have the following prerequisite skills:



- Familiarity with basic machine learning concepts such as supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, and neural networks will be beneficial.
- Experience with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and understanding of algorithms and data structures would be advantageous.
- Ideally, attendees should have practical experience with a programming language, preferably Python, given its prominence in machine learning and AI development. Those without programming background can follow along with the labs.
- Basic knowledge of cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure will be useful, especially regarding how they support machine learning operations and AI security.
- A general understanding of the software development process or lifecycle (SDLC), including stages like design, development, testing, and deployment, will be helpful as MLOps is a similar, but more specific, lifecycle.
