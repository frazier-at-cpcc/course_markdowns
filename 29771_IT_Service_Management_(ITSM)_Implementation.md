## Summary
Attend IT Service Management Implementation to learn about ITSM applications and related functionality, which may be configured during an implementation using a low-code or no-code approach. IT Service Management (ITSM) is a concept that involves the delivery of IT services to customers and users. Most IT services are centered around technology and the support and maintenance activities that must occur to operate and maintain the technology. The ServiceNow ITSM Implementation course puts those basic capabilities to use. It provides practical skills that may be applied immediately to accelerate ITSM implementations.

This course aligns with common and practical implementation scenarios and challenges when configuring a ServiceNow instance for implementation, using a low-code or no-code approach.

This course focuses on the baseline capabilities, security and architecture of these ITSM applications and processes:


- Incident Management
- Problem Management
- Change Management
- Service Catalog and Request Management
- Service Portfolio Management
Information on Configuration Management (including Common Service Data Model), Knowledge Management, and Release Management, and how they are used to support the ITSM applications listed above, is also provided.

An exam voucher is included in the course price.
