## Objective
This course focuses on enabling you to do the following:


- Identify the different software components in the ONTAP architecture.
- Analyze the methodologies for troubleshooting management component applications, networks, and protocols.
- Use troubleshooting workflows to identify failure symptoms, determine potential causes, and resolve issues.
- Use debugging commands, logs, and tools to identify, isolate, and fix complex technical issues that involve different core components.
- Analyze the health of a cluster and summarize the results.
- Identify issues with the management component.
- Use administrative commands to verify the configuration of NFS and SAN environments.
- Use the troubleshooting methodology for NAS and SAN protocols to define and isolate issues.
- Locate logs for the management component, network, NFS, SMB, and iSCSI protocols.
- Collect data for support cases.
