## Objective
After you successfully complete this course, expect to be able to:



- Interpret technical requirements
- Articulate the business value to multiple stakeholders
- Proficient in designing solutions that are secure, redundant, scalable and resilient
- Use your knowledge of the appropriate validated solution guide to meet the customer's business needs

## Essentials
It is strongly recommended that the candidate already hold the Aruba Certified Switching Professional (ACSP) or have taken Implementing AOS-CX Switching (ICXS) or have experience deploying HPE Aruba Networking solutions in an enterprise environment.

## Audience
The ideal candidate for this certification is a senior technical professional. Examples of appropriate experience may include: principal engineer, network consultant, presales consultant, solutions architect, networking SME, network security architect, or technical member from architecture teams.

## Outline
Discover Requirements


- Define the goals
- Identify current environment (ossible constraints, depending on project)
- Identify the objectives
- Collect information
Analyze Requirements


- Determine possible high-level solutions
- Map the requirements into technical solutions
- Evaluate the proposed solution against the known dependencies and project objectives
- Document assumptions
Architect the Solution


- Identify the solution options that meet the business needs
- Design high-level topologies
- Select the correct products
- Determine the appropriate overlay and underlay design
- Validate that the design meets the original requirements
Propose the Solution


- Create the design documentation
- Present the solution
- Create final design

## Summary
This course helps architects to gain the skills required to design an HPE Aruba Networking Campus Access switching solution. An architect is an IT professional proficient in interpreting technical requirements to create and design secure, redundant, scalable, resilient, or high-performing infrastructure-consistent with appropriate validated solution guide per business needs. Architects are able to interpret complex requirements and constraints to design an optimal HPE Aruba Networking solution.

The candidate can take HPE Aruba Networking solutions and articulate the business value to multiple stakeholders. The architect needs to have vast technical knowledge across the products and solutions. These solutions may require a migration and/or deployment strategy from/into an existing architecture. They need to understand the design implications of third-party interoperability (hardware/software). Additionally, the candidate will have extensive experience building solutions and optimizing applications and workloads.
