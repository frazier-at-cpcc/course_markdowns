## Summary
Getting Started with React / Introduction to React Basics is a three-day hands-on course designed to get students quickly up and running with Core React skills. Geared for more experienced web developers new to React, this course provides students with the core knowledge and hands-on skills they require to build reliable, powerful React apps.

Throughout the course students will explore React fundamentals with a progressive, example-driven approach. You’ll create your first apps, learn how to write components, start handling user interaction, and manage rich forms. We end the first part by exploring the inner workings of Create React App (Facebook’s tool for running React apps), and building a multi-page app that uses client-side routing.

Every project in this course was built using Create React App. Create React App is based on Webpack, a tool which helps process and bundle our various JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and image files. We explore Create React App in-depth in the module “Using Webpack with Create React App.”

Students will build Single Page Applications (SPA), create robust routing with error handling, and both class and functional reusable components.
The lab project will also include the use of form validation.
