## Summary
Through a combination of lectures and hands-on labs, you will learn the fundamentals of automation with Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (Cisco ACI®), such as data formats and types as well as their value in network automation, and how to use DevOps tools, including Ansible and Git. You will then learn how to integrate programmability and automation with Cisco ACI. You will study software development toolkits, industry-standard workflows, tools, and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), such as Python, Ansible, Git, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), YAML Ain’t Markup Language (YAML), Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF), Representational State Configuration Protocol (RESTCONF), and Yet Another Generation (YANG).
