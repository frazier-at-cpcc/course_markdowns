## Objective
- Describe the history of IP version 4 (IPv4) and the rationale for implementing IPv6 to resolve IPv4 addressing and security issues
- Explain the benefits of addressing with IPv6 and describe how larger IPv6 address sizes facilitate auto configuration and aggregation
- Describe the market drivers that help promote IPv6 as the key technology of the future
- Describe the IPv6 addressing architecture, including types of addresses and address representation
- Describe changes in the IPv6 header and the purpose of extension headers
- Describe and use Cisco IOS software commands to enable IPv6 on Cisco routers
- Describe internet control message protocol (ICMP) types and codes and IPv6 neighbor discovery, which is the process in which neighbors discover each other and autoconfigure addresses
- Describe the IPv6 configuration process on Cisco IOS software and provide some basic methods for troubleshooting issues that relate to IPv6 configurations
- Explain IP mobility in general and describe the IPv6 network mobility model with possible usages
- Describe how domain name system (DNS) works in an IPv6 environment
- Describe dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) version 6 (DHCPv6) for IPv6 operations, including how DHCP operation in IPv6 differs from its operation in IPv4 and how you can implement DHCPv6 prefix delegation to improve the IPv6 numbering process
- Describe the fields in the IPv6 header that are used to support quality of service (QoS) and explain how these fields differ from the IPv4 QoS model
- Describe Cisco IOS tools, such as Telnet, Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), Secure Shell Protocol (SSH), and others
- Describe open shortest path first (OSPF)v3, the IPv6-capable version of the OSPF routing protocol, including its operations, configuration, and commands
- Describe Cisco enhanced interior gateway routing protocol (EIGRP), including its operation, configuration, and commands
- Explore multiprotocol border gateway protocol (MP-BGP), including operation, IPv6-related configuration, and commands
- Explain the issues when using policy-based routing (PBR) and when disabling the processing of extension headers
- Describe the characteristics of first hop redundancy protocol (FHRP) for IPv6, which are used to offer redundant connections on the network layer for upstream connectivity
- Describe redistribution of IPv6 routing information, differences among various routing protocols, and changes in the behavior of redistribution compared to IPv4
- Describe the IPv6 multicast addresses format, including a real-life multicast example
- Describe IPv6 multicast addressing options, media access control (MAC) address mappings, and multicast address scoping
- Describe the dual-stacking approach to integrating IPv6 functionality into an existing IPv4-only environment
- Describe tunneling mechanisms for IPv4-to-IPv6 transition, or for supporting IPv4 and IPv6 coexistence
- Explain the benefits of adopting IPv6 single stack instead of using both IPv4 and IPv6 and the process for converting networks from IPv4 to IPv6
- Describe the features of access control lists (ACLs) in an IPv6 environment
- Describe how security is implemented in IPv6
- Describe security issues in an IPv6 transition environment
- Describe security practices for IPv6 deployment
- Describe how Cisco IOS Firewall works and how to configure it in Pv6 traffic
- Describe the IPv6 networking environments in use today, the process of becoming an IPv6 internet service provider (ISPs), address allocation policies and organizations, and strategies for connecting to the IPv6 internet
- Identify an IPv6 multihoming issue and prescribe a potential solution
- Describe several IPv6 enterprise deployment strategies
- Explain how to deploy IPv6 over a multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) network
- Describe IPv6 broadband access services and digital subscriber line (DSL)-based access in particular
- Describe how to plan and implement IPv6 in enterprise networks
- Describe how plan and implement IPv6 cloud and software-defined deployments
- Describe and identify the most common planning and implementation approaches as they pertain to moving to IPv6 in branch networks
