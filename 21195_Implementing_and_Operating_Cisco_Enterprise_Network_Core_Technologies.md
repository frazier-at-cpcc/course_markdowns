- Troubleshoot Layer 2 connectivity using VLANs and trunking
- Implement redundant switched networks using Spanning Tree Protocol
- Troubleshoot link aggregation using Etherchannel
- Describe the features, metrics, and path selection concepts of Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
- Implement and optimize Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)v2 and OSPFv3, including adjacencies, packet types and areas, summarization, and route filtering for IPv4 and IPv6
- Implement External Border Gateway Protocol (EBGP) interdomain routing, path selection, and single and dual-homed networking
- Implement network redundancy using protocols such as Hot Standby Routing Protocol (HSRP) and Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)
- Implement internet connectivity within Enterprise using static and dynamic Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Describe the virtualization technology of servers, switches, and the various network devices and components
- Implement overlay technologies such as Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF), Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), VPN, and Location Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP)
- Describe the components and concepts of wireless networking, including Radio Frequency (RF) and antenna characteristics, and define the specific wireless standards
- Describe the various wireless deployment models available, including autonomous Access Point (AP) deployments and cloud-based designs within the centralized Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) architecture
- Describe wireless roaming and location services
