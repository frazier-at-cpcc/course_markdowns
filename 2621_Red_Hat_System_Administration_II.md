These skills can help improve system reliability and storage utilization efficiency, while making responsiveness to system failures faster and more accurate. This course is the second of a two-part series that takes a computer professional from minimal Linux experience to being a fully capable Linux administrator.

Red Hat has created this course in a way intended to benefit our customers, but each company and infrastructure is unique, and actual results or benefits may vary.

Impact of this training

As a result of attending this course, you should be able to perform the key tasks needed to become a full-time Linux administrator. You will be introduced to more advanced administrative topics, such as storage management using LVM, SELinux management, and automated installation. This course goes deeper into enterprise Linux administration, including file systems and partitioning, logical volumes, SELinux, firewall configuration, and troubleshooting.

## Essentials
Successful completion of Red Hat System Administration I (RH124) is recommended. Experienced Linux administrators seeking to accelerate their path toward becoming a Red Hat Certified System Administrator should start with the RHCSA Rapid Track Course (RH199).
