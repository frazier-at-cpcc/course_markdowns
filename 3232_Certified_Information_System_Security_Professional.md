## Essentials
Candidates must have a minimum of five years cumulative, full-time experience in two or more of the eight domains of the current CISSP Exam Outline. Earning a post-secondary degree (bachelors or masters) in computer science, information technology (IT) or related fields may satisfy up to one year of the required experience or an additional credential from the ISC2 approved list may satisfy up to one year of the required experience.
