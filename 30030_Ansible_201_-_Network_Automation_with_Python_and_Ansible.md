## Summary
Continue your studies of Ansible, with a focus on automating common elements within the network. In addition to Ansible, students will study enough Python to understand Ansible’s plugin architecture. Lessons and labs focus on using both Python and Ansible to interact with and configure your network devices. At the conclusion of this course you will return to work empowered with skills necessary to automate network management. This class is a combination of live demonstrations and hands-on labs with virtual network devices and endpoints as targets for your configuration.
