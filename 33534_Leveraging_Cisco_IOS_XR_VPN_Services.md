## Summary
The Leveraging IOS XR VPN Services (XRVPNS) training teaches you how to implement and troubleshoot Layer 2 and Layer 3 Virtual Private Network services in a service provider network operating on Cisco IOS XR software. Cisco IOS XR is the foundational operating system of most service provider networks and operates Ciscoâ€™s service provider portfolio of network devices. You will learn how to implement a label switched network infrastructure for the enablement of VPN services using Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) or Segment Routing (SR). You will also learn how to implement and troubleshoot both IPv4 and IPv6 Layer 3 VPN services and Multicast VPN services using IOS XR. In addition, you will learn how to implement Ethernet VPN (EVPN) services including EVPN Integrated Routing and Bridging (EVPN IRB) and EVPN-SR data center fabric. Finally, you will learn how to implement EVPN advanced features.
