## Summary
Incorporating machine learning into data pipelines increases the ability to extract insights from data. This course covers ways machine learning can be included in data pipelines on Google Cloud. For little to no customization, this course covers AutoML. For more tailored machine learning capabilities, this course introduces Notebooks and BigQuery machine learning (BigQuery ML). Also, this course covers how to productionalize machine learning solutions by using Vertex AI.
