## Summary
Mile2’s Ultimate Red vs Blue Team Course is built to provide intense hands-on sessions that emulates real-world cyber warfare and defense scenarios. You will implement principles and behaviors you have learned to combat malicious hackers that use advanced threat techniques.  
 
The intent is that the students will have 3 – 4 hours to interact with each section. In the Day 1 Morning scenario, you will access Proximo and Gracchus.  The Day 2 Afternoon work will be in Priscus and Verus.  Then, in the Day 2 Morning scenario you will access Maxiums and Quintas.  Finally, Day 2 Afternoon work will be in Tetraites and Cummodus.
 
In each segment of Red vs Blue you will have the first 30 minutes to organize your team. After this, you will have up to 3 hours and 30 minutes to attack the other machines and to place your team name in the flag.txt file. Once a team name is in the flag.txt file, it cannot be removed. The team that places their team name in as many flag.txt files as possible will be the winning team for that segment.
