## Summary
The Implementing Aruba Network Security course covers intermediate security concepts and prepares candidates to take the exam to achieve Aruba Certified Networking Security Professional (ACNSP) certification. This course helps admins use the Aruba portfolio to implement Zero Trust Security (ZTS) and protect their networks from threats. It explains how to configure Aruba network infrastructure and ClearPass solutions to authenticate and control both wired and wireless users, as well as remote users on a client-to-site VPN. The course further explains how to collect a variety of contextual information on ClearPass Policy Manager (CPPM) and implement advanced role mapping and enforcement policies. The course also covers using ClearPass Device Insight to enhance visibility. Learners will learn how to set up features such as the ArubaOS-CX Network Analytics Engine (NAE), Aruba Wireless Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention System (WIDS/WIPS), and Aruba gateway IDS/IPS, as well as how to investigate alerts.
