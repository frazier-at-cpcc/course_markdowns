Hands-on Activities may include: Building an AI-Assisted Chatbot


- Project Overview:
- Objective: Create a chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide information, and perform basic tasks like booking appointments or answering FAQs.
- Technologies: Python for backend (using libraries like Flask), AI services (like OpenAI's GPT for natural language processing), and JavaScript for frontend integration if needed.
- Initial Setup and Planning:
- GitHub Copilot Assistance: Suggesting the project structure, initial Flask setup, and dependencies required.
- Task: Create a basic web server setup with Flask.
- Integrating Chatbot with AI Services:
- Objective: Connect the chatbot with an AI service like OpenAI's GPT-3 for natural language understanding and response generation.
- GitHub Copilot Assistance: Providing code snippets for integrating the OpenAI API, handling API requests, and processing responses.
- Building Chat Functionalities:
- Objective: Develop functionalities such as user query processing, response generation, and context management.
- GitHub Copilot Assistance: Generating code for parsing user input, managing chat sessions, and generating contextual responses.
- Frontend Integration:
- Objective: Create a simple and user-friendly interface for the chatbot.
- GitHub Copilot Assistance: If using a web frontend, Copilot can assist in writing JavaScript or TypeScript code to handle user inputs and display responses. It can
- also suggest frameworks or libraries for UI components.
- Testing and Refining:
- Objective: Test the chatbot for various scenarios and improve its accuracy and user interaction.
- GitHub Copilot Assistance: Generating test cases, especially for edge cases in conversation flows, and suggesting improvements in code for handling unexpected user inputs.
- Advanced Features (Optional):
- Objective: Add advanced features like voice recognition, multilingual support, or integration with external services (e.g., calendars for booking appointments).
- GitHub Copilot Assistance: Providing code examples and API integration snippets for these advanced features.
- Deployment:
- Objective: Deploy the chatbot on a server or cloud platform.
- GitHub Copilot Assistance: Suggesting deployment scripts, Docker container configurations, or cloud deployment procedures.
