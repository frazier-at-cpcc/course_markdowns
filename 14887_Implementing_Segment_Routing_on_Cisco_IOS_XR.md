## Objective
After taking this course, you should be able to:



- Describe the key concepts of segment routing
- Implement and verify IGP segment routing
- Migrate an existing Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) LDP-based network to segment routing
- Implement and verify TI-LFA segment routing
- Instantiate segment routing policies
- Instantiate multidomain segment routing policies
- Configure and verify BGP prefix segments and SR-based services

## Essentials
Before taking this course, you should have:



- Familiarity with Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS®) XR software
- Knowledge of general networking concepts

## Audience
- Systems engineers
- Network engineers
- Field engineers
- Technical support personnel
- Channel partners and resellers

## Outline
- Introduction to Segment Routing
- IGP Segment Routing Implementation and Verification
- Segment Routing and LDP Interworking
- Topology Independent – Loop Free Alternate
- Segment Routing Policies – Traffic Engineering (SR-TE)
- Multidomain SR Policies
- BGP Prefix Segment and Egress Peer Engineering

## Summary
The Implementing Segment Routing on Cisco IOS XR (SEGRTE201) v2.0 course covers the fundamental concepts of Segment Routing (SR), how to configure and verify segment routing within an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), and the interworking of Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) with segment routing. You will learn how to implement Topology-Independent Loop-Free Alternate (TI-LFA) using segment routing, and how to instantiate and verify segment routing traffic engineering policies. You will also learn how to implement segment routing within Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). 


How you'll benefit


This course will help you:



- Learn how to configure and verify segment routing within an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
- Prepare to implement topology-independent loop-free alternate using segment routing
- Learn to implement segment routing within Border Gateway Protocol
