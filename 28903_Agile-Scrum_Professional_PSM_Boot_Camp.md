Lesson 1: Agile & Scrum Introduction


In order for us to understand the benefits of Scrum and the nuances behind its framework, we begin with the history of agile methods and how relatively new thoughts in software development have brought us to Scrum.
Lessons



- 1.1.	Introductions
- 1.2.	PSM-1 Certification
- 1.3.	What is Agility?
- 1.4.	Waterfall vs Agile

Exercise: Take the PSM-1 Open Assessment on Srum.org

The free Open Assessment will give us a baseline concerning our understanding of Scrum as a class.

This more in-depth set of questions will begin to help us understand the concepts of Scrum in greater detail.

Lesson 3: Agile Principles


Scrum is one of many frameworks for “doing Agile”, and is the most popular. In this lesson, we will expand into the broader concepts of Agile including Prioritization, Estimating, Decomposition, Velocity & Capacity, Technical Debt & Risk.
Lessons



- 3.1.	Basic Concepts
- 3.2.	Prioritization & Voting
- 3.3.	Communications
- 3.4.	User Stories & Points
- 3.4.1.	  I-N-V-E-S-T in Stories
- 3.4.2.	  Epics
- 3.4.3.	  Personas
- 3.5.	Velocity & Capacity
- 3.5.1.	  Estimating
- 3.5.2.	  Velocity
- 3.5.3.	  Capacity
- 3.6.	Technical Debt
- 3.7.	Managing Risk
Exercise: Complete a quiz as a class on the Agile concepts. 
This in-depth set of questions will begin to help us understand the concepts of Agile in greater detail.

Exercise: Select a “Mock Project”, and review the Project Vision, Project Planning Process, and Product Backlog Items. Select the roles of Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Dev. Team members. 
This will be a fast-paced simulation of kicking off a new product within a Scrum framework.

Lesson 4: Planning & Scaling


Scrum exists within a larger context of Portfolio, Product & Release planning. In this lesson, we cover how these concepts are layered around the core concepts of Scrum.

Basic Scrum imposes a limit of 9 Developers on the Scrum Team. How are we to manage Scrum if we have 20, 30, 50 or more team members? This lesson will cover how to “scale” (expand) Scrum using techniques such as the Scrum-of-Scrums, and the Scrum Nexus (Schwaber, 2018).
Lessons



- 4.1.	Levels of Planning
- 4.1.1.	  Multilevel Planning
- 4.1.2.	  Portfolio Planning
- 4.1.3.	  Product Planning

- 4.1.5.	  Sprint Planning
- 4.1.6.	  Daily Planning
- 4.2.	Scaling Scrum
- 4.2.1.	  Multiple-Team Coordination
- 4.2.2.	  Scrum of Scrums
- 4.2.3.	  Scaling with Nexus
Exercise: Understand Customer Expectations, & Iterative Sprinting

This exercise will expose the class to what it’s like to truly understand our customers’ expectations, and to deliver value & functional product in a fast-paced, time-boxed Scrum environment.

During this first portion of the exercise, we’ll work with a fictional customer and product, to understand their needs, and continually adapt to what constitutes “value” for them.
The class will do multiple simulations of Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective. 

Lesson 5: Review


We will review all the concepts covered in the course, with the time allotted for trying our hand at more review questions. Finally, we will take the Scrum.org Open Assessment (the same quiz we did on day 1) to benchmark our enhanced knowledge of the Scrum framework.

Lessons



- 5.1.	Concepts
- 5.2.	Open Assessment

## Summary
Beginning with the history of Agile development and moving through the disciplines promoted by Scrum, this Scrum Master (PSM) training course will give you a comprehensive understanding of the Scrum framework while specifically reviewing the behaviors expected of a Scrum Master. This 3-day Professional Scrum Master training course is suitable for those practicing or looking to practice the art of the Scrum Master but is highly valuable for anyone involved in Scrum (Department Managers, Team Members, Product Managers, etc.).

Even projects that have solid, well-defined project plans encounter some degree of change and waste. Shifting market conditions, budget cuts, staff restructuring, or any number of influences will disrupt the best plan while contributing to customer dissatisfaction and staff discouragement. Moreover, projects that begin with partial or unclear requirements make it difficult to even establish project expectations. Scrum is a flexible (“agile”) development process that allows teams to deliver usable software or product periodically throughout the life of the project, evolving with new requirements as the project proceeds
