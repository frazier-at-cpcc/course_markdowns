## Summary
During this five-day course, you focus on using VMware vRealize® Orchestrator™ to extend the functionality of VMware vRealize® Automation™. You learn how to provide XaaS (Anything as a Service) and implement Machine Lifecycle Extensibility using the VMware vRealize® Automation™ Event Broker. You also learn how to create vRealize Orchestrator workflows and vRealize Automation ABX actions. You learn about various features, including basic scripting implementation along with logic processing to implement a variety of functions to use in your environment.  This course teaches implementing debugging, loops, conditions, and user interactions in vRealize Orchestrator.

The course introduces the new vRealize Orchestrator HTML 5 interface, along with API calls and REST functions, to give you the groundwork to implement a variety of plugins and scripts. This course is designed to give you the tools to craft custom solutions in the product.
