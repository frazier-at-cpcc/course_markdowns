## Summary
This will be a more advanced exploration of the libraries that developers will have been exposed to, deep learning, additional models, operationalization concerns of these systems, and the often-forgotten security aspects of data-driven systems. The goal will be to have as many hands-on activities as is feasible intermixed with a sufficient amount of theory to motivate the exercises.
