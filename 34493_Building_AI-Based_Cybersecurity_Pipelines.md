## Summary
Traditional cybersecurity methods include creating barriers around your infrastructure to protect it from intruders. However, as enterprises continue to digitally transform, they’re faced with a proliferation of devices, more sophisticated cybersecurity attacks, and an incredibly vast network of data to protect—which means new cybersecurity methodologies must be explored. An alternative approach is to address cybersecurity as a data science problem: Aim to better understand all the users and activities across your network so that you can identify which transactions are typical and which are potentially nefarious.
