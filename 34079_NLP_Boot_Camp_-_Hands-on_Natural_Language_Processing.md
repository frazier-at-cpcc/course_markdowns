## Summary
The Hands-on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI Boot Camp is an immersive, three-day course that serves as your comprehensive guide to building machines that can read, interpret, and even generate human language. This unique interdisciplinary field blends computational linguistics with artificial intelligence, allowing machines to understand, interpret, generate, and interact using human language. In a data-centric world, mastering NLP and Generative AI skills gives you a competitive edge, enabling the development of sophisticated applications like voice assistants, text analyzers, chatbots, and more, with an added flair of creativity and human-like interaction.

Our expansive curriculum encompasses a wide array of NLP and Generative AI topics. Beginning with an introduction to NLP, feature extraction, and the basics of Generative AI, the course progresses to hands-on development of text classifiers and exploration of web scraping, APIs, and AI assistants. Delving deeper, you’ll explore topic modeling, vector representations, advanced text manipulation, sentiment analysis, and the innovative world of text and image generation using AI. Half of your time will be dedicated to practical labs, where you'll apply your knowledge in real-world scenarios—creating pipelines, text classifiers, working with web data, analyzing sentiment, and experimenting with AI-generated content. These labs mirror actual industry challenges, equipping you with the necessary skills to efficiently process, analyze, and generate text data. Time permitting, you’ll engage with modern tools like Python libraries, the OpenAI GPT-4 API, TensorFlow, and others in a series of hands-on exercises.

By the end of this course, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of both NLP and Generative AI. You’ll leave equipped with practical skills and insights to process and analyze text data, implement advanced text representations, apply machine learning algorithms for text data, build simple chatbots, and creatively use AI for generating text and images. You'll be adept at harnessing these technologies to gain valuable insights from text data, enhance business processes, and improve user interactions with automated text-based and generative AI systems.

Hands-on: Build a Unique GPT Assistant from Scratch

During the course, one of the projects you will complete involves harnessing the power of OpenAI APIs to create a unique GPT assistant, which we call "MeGPT."
