## Summary
In this course, students learn Session Initiation Protocol and important protocols related to SIP implementations. This course thoroughly explains what SIP is, how it works, and also provides a practical guide on how to use it. The lessons in this course are clear and very technical. In this course, students will examine how SIP interoperates in the current telecommunications network, going beyond the basics of the protocol and getting a big picture understanding of how it all fits together.

At the end of the course, students will receive access to the Alta3 Research SIP certification exam. Upon successful completion of the exam, students will be awarded a SIP certificate.

A vendor-agnostic study of Session Initiation Protocol designed for the person that must make SIP work.
