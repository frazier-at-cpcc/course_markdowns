## Summary
The three-day NIST Cybersecurity Bootcamp course is a combination of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NCSF) Foundation and Practitioner Training courses. The bootcamp provides a deep dive into the components of the NIST CSF and NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) and how they align to risk management. The course will follow the principles of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to design and implement (or improve) a cybersecurity program to protect critical assets. The bootcamp details defense in depth, creation of a Written Information Security Program, and implementing ongoing assessments for a continuous improvement plan. This course is suited for individuals working with and overseeing the cybersecurity of an organization, including CIOs, CISOs, IT Security workforce, and IT Directors/Managers/Personnel.
