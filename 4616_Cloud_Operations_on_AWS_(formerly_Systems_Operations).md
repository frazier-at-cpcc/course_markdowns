## Objective
In this course, you will learn to:


- Identify the AWS services that support the different phases of Operational Excellence, an AWS Well-Architected Framework pillar
- Manage access to AWS resources using AWS accounts and organizations and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Maintain an inventory of in-use AWS resources by using AWS services, such as AWS Systems Manager, AWS CloudTrail, and AWS Config
- Develop a resource deployment strategy using metadata tags, Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), and AWS Control Tower to deploy and maintain an AWS cloud environment
- Automate resource deployment by using AWS services, such as AWS CloudFormation and AWS Service Catalog
- Use AWS services to manage AWS resources through CloudOps lifecycle processes, such as deployments and patches
- Configure a highly available cloud environment that uses AWS services, such as Amazon Route 53 and Elastic Load Balancing, to route traffic for optimal latency and performance
- Configure AWS Auto Scaling and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to scale out your cloud environment based on demand
- Use Amazon CloudWatch and associated features, such as alarms, dashboards, and widgets, to monitor your cloud environment
- Manage permissions and track activity in your cloud environment by using AWS services, such as AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config
- Deploy your resources to an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), establish necessary connectivity to your Amazon VPC, and protect your resources from disruptions of service
- State the purpose, benefits, and appropriate use cases for mountable storage in your AWS Cloud environment
- Explain the operational characteristics of object storage in the AWS Cloud, including Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon S3 Glacier
- Build a comprehensive cost model to help gather, optimize, and predict your cloud costs by using services such as AWS Cost Explorer and the AWS Cost & Usage Report
