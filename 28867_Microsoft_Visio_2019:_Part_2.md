Appendix A: Using Diagram Standards

## Summary
Microsoft Visio stands out among similar applications because of its unique ability to draw a wide variety of diagrams, flowcharts, workflows, and organization structures—anything that can be represented by shapes connected by lines. Most importantly, these shapes can be rearranged and with corresponding lines remaining intact. Visio has improved over the years as features common among Microsoft Office applications have been added. Today, Visio is well integrated with other members of the Office family as well as Microsoft's cloud-based services. This greatly enriches the sharing and publishing of Visio drawings. 

In Microsoft Visio 2019: Part 1, students learned the basic skills needed to create and modify various Visio drawings. In Microsoft Visio 2019: Part 2, students will learn about more advanced features— making them a more efficient and effective Visio user.
