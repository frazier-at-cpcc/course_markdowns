## Objective
After you successfully complete this course, expect to be able to:



- Compare AOS-CX switching models and describe features
- Use NAE and scripts to ease monitoring, troubleshooting of operational issues as well as sFlow traffic flows and port mirroring
- Describe VSX use cases, operation, and best practices for resiliency and scalability
- Describe and configure access control lists for improved security, protecting management traffic and ease troubleshooting
- Describe and deploy multiarea OSPF networks, virtual links and improved convergence times as well as security
- Establish, monitor, manipulate, and filter BGP route relationships, path selection and advertisements
- Describe multicast addressing, IGMP, and IGMP snooping
- Describe and implement Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)- Dense mode (PIM-DM) and Sparse mode (PIM-SM)
- Describe the components of 802.1x authentication, implementing it on AOS-CX switch ports, and integrate it with HPE Aruba Networking ClearPass
- Implement RADIUS-based MAC authentication and device profiles
- Understand user-based tunneling and configure Dynamic Segmentation and PAPI
- Describe and implement various Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms, including classifications, marking, queues and schedules
- Implement VRF to isolate routed traffic and manipulate traffic routing with Policy-Based Routing (PBR)
- Understand and configure captive portal configuration with ClearPass Guest and BYOD solutions

## Essentials
It is highly recommended that candidates already have some advanced knowledge of networking (routing, switching, and security). Candidates are encouraged to have taken the AOS-CX Switching Fundamentals (CXSF) course and achieved the ACA - Switching certification.

Please take this short self-assessment to make sure whether Implementing AOS-CX Switching is the right course for you.

## Audience
Typical candidates for this course have experience in advanced level implementation and maintenance of wired solutions. They possess experience assessing and interpreting existing networks and network design documentation. They regularly troubleshoot, resolve issues, and perform ongoing support of large network environments. They have familiarity with wired network security best practices and perform duties independently with at least two years of experience working as a member of the team that supports maintaining multiple campus topologies, edge branches, and data center networks.

## Summary
This 5-day course prepares you for the updated AOS-CX switching-based ACP - Switching certification exam (Exam Code: HPE7-A08).  Attending this course will teach you the advanced skills necessary to implement and operate enterprise-level HPE Aruba Networking switching solutions. You will build on the skills you learned at the Associate level to configure and manage modern, open standards-based networking solutions using HPE Aruba Networking AOS-CX routing and switching technologies. In this course, you will learn about AOS-CX switch technologies:



- Securing port access with HPE Aruba Networking Dynamic Segmentation
- Redundancy technologies such as Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP)
- Link aggregation techniques, including Link Aggregation Protocol (LACP)
- Switch virtualization with HPE Aruba Networking Virtual Switching eXtension (VSX) and HPE Aruba Networking Virtual Switching Framework (VSF)
This course is approximately 50% lecture and 50% hands-on lab exercises.
