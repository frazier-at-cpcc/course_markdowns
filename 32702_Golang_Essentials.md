## Summary
Master the features of the Go Programming Language!  Learn how to program using this open-source programming language, developed and supported by Google!.  Hands-on Labs and environment reinforce skills.

Go is designed to be concise, clean, and efficient. It is easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines.   Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the feel of a dynamically typed, interpreted language. 

Be it system admins, network, cloud, or storage engineers, all lessons in our courseware are highly relevant for using Go to craft enterprise solutions.
