## Summary
This course is designed for developers concerned with integrating performance testing into their release processes, and for SREs concerned with web availability monitoring, enterprise application monitoring, and SLA reporting. Splunk Synthetic Monitoring is built primarily for DevOps and IT Ops teams proactively monitoring critical business workflows. However, the course can be taken by anyone who needs 24/7 visibility into the performance of web services for customers and employees around the world.

This 6-hour (1 virtual day) course describes how to identify the appropriate use cases for synthetic tests, create uptime tests for monitoring site availability, create robust browser tests for monitoring critical browser-based workflows, and use API tests to monitor back-end services and API-powered workflows. You will be able to create custom dashboards and charts to proactively troubleshoot and optimize web performance based on synthetic metrics.

All concepts are taught using lectures and scenario-based hands-on activities.
