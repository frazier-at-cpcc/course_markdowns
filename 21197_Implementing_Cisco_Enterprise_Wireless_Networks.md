## Summary
The Implementing Cisco Enterprise Wireless Networks (ENWLSI) training helps you implement network settings to provide a secure wireless network infrastructure and troubleshoot any related issues. The goal of this 5-day instructor-led training is to prepare you to secure and implement the wireless infrastructure, and use Cisco Identity Service Engine (ISE), Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI), Cisco DNA Center, Cisco Spaces, and Cisco Connect Mobile Experience to monitor and troubleshoot network issues. 

This training provides you with hands-on labs to reinforce concepts including deploying Cisco Catalyst 9800 Wireless Controller Release IOS XE Bengaluru 17.6.3, Cisco Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center Release 2.3.3, Cisco Prime Infrastructure Release 3.5, Cisco Spaces, Cisco CMX Release 10.5, features, and Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Release 3.0. 

This training prepares you for the 300-430 ENWLSI: Implementing Cisco Enterprise Wireless Networks exam. If passed, you earn the Cisco Certified Specialist – Enterprise Wireless Implementation certification and satisfy the concentration exam requirement for the CCNP Enterprise certification.

Our lab utilizes physical access points (9120, 3802), physical wireless clients as well as real DNAC and PI. This allows further exploration of the dashboard.
