## Objective
After completing the course, you should be able to:


- Get familiar with different API styles (REST, RPC) and synchronous and asynchronous API requests
- Learn how to use Postman software development tool in order to test the API calls
- Learn how to automate repetitive tasks using Ansible automation engine
- Explore a Python programming language, Python libraries and Python virtual environments and learn how can they be used for automation of network configuration tasks
- Get introduced to GIT version control system and its common operations
- Learn how to leverage the various models and APIs of the Cisco IOS XE platform to perform day-zero operations, improve troubleshooting methodologies with custom tools, augment the CLI using scripts, and integrate various workflows using Ansible and Python
- Learn about the paradigm shift of model-driven telemetry and the building blocks of a working solution
- Learn how to leverage the tools and APIs to automate Cisco DNA infrastructure managed by Cisco DNA Centerâ„¢
- Demonstrate workflows (configuration, verification, health checking, and monitoring) using Python, Ansible, and Postman
- Understand Cisco SD-WAN solution components, implement a Python library that works with the Cisco SD-WAN APIs to perform configuration, inventory management, and monitoring tasks, and implement reusable Ansible roles to automate provisioning new branch sites on an existing Cisco SD-WAN infrastructure
- Learn how to leverage the tools and APIs to automate Cisco Meraki managed infrastructure and demonstrate workflows (configuration, verification, health checking, monitoring) using Python, Ansible, and Postman
