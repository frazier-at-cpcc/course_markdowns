## Summary
Learn how to install, configure, and use NetApp® Astra Trident to manage Kubernetes with NetApp ONTAP® based storage systems. Deploy Astra Trident by using the Trident operator and use the tridentctl and kubectl methods to manage configurations. Configure NFS-backed, iSCSI-backed, and NVMe over TCP (NVMe/TCP) backed storage by using Astra Trident. Also, manage Snapshot copies, expand volumes, and import non-Astra Trident volumes to become managed volumes.
Written for Kubernetes v1.29 and Astra Trident 24.02, this course includes an appendix on how to monitor Astra Trident by using Prometheus and Grafana.
