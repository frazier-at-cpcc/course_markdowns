## Summary
The Natural Language Processing with Python training course is designed to teach participants the concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and also to provide hands-on experience dealing with text data. The course will help participants to detect patterns in textual data using Python. The course begins with an overview of NLP and some key techniques in NLP. Next, students will write their own spam detection code and sentiment analysis code in Python. The course then looks at Deep Learning, RNNs, Attention Models, Sequence Models and working with BERT Models. The course concludes with a look at using BERT for Q&A Systems.

Purpose:

Promote an in-depth understanding on how to use Natural Language Processing in your Python applications.
