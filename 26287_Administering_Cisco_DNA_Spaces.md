## Summary
Cisco DNA Spaces helps resolve physical-space ‘blind spots’ in an organization. Through the Cisco wireless infrastructure, organizations can gain insights into how people and things move throughout their physical spaces. Based on these insights, organizations can drive operational efficiencies by monitoring and managing the location, movement, and utilization of assets.

Upon completion of the first day of the course, you will be able to describe how the DNA Spaces solution drives operational efficiencies in both consumer and enterprise environments. You will be able to cite use cases from major industry verticals. You will be able to identify procedures and applications when implementing DNA spaces in an organization that is getting ‘back to business’ during the Covid-19 period. You will be able to describe the three phases that comprise the DNA Spaces solution ‘SEE - ACT - EXTEND’.  In addition, you will learn the solution’s security features in the context of customer data compliance requirements, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  Finally, you will be able to explain the DNA spaces licensing model.

The second and third days of the course you will review both basic and advanced ‘SEE – ACT – EXTEND’ elements. In addition, you will consider Data Analytics in the context of DNA Spaces. You will simultaneously perform a hands-on ‘deep-dive’ into the product. You will obtain an account in the DNA Spaces cloud, and then perform on-boarding of your lab pod’s wireless infrastructure. Subsequently, you will configure the DNA Spaces solution based on the ‘SEE – ACT - EXTEND’ model reviewed in day one. This will include elements such as behavioral metrics, location analytics, captive portals, profiling, customer engagements, Internet of Things, asset identification and management, and API interfaces for streaming and notifications. Through these activities you will familiarize yourself with the DNA Spaces App Center and IoT Device Marketplace.

The course qualifies for 18 Cisco Continuing Education Credits (CE).
