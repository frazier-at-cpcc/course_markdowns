## Objective
After completing this course the student should be able to:



- Explain the need for QoS, describe the fundamentals of QoS policy, and identify and describe the different models that are used for ensuring QoS in a network
- Explain the use of MQC and AutoQoS to implement QoS on the network and describe some of the mechanisms used to monitor QoS implementations
- Given a converged network and a policy defining QoS on the network and describe some of the mechanisms used to monitor QoS implementations
- Use Cisco QoS queuing mechanisms to manage network congestion
- Use Cisco QoS congestion avoidance mechanisms to reduce the effects of congestion on the network
- Describe how link efficiency mechanisms can be used collectively to improve bandwidth efficiency and reduce delay
- Describe the need for wireless QoS in WLANs due to the expansion of high-bandwidth data applications and time-sensitive multimedia applications in vertical and enterprise environments, and the need for a unified approach to support multi-vendor time-sensitive applications and accelerate the adoption rate of QoS
- Describe the need for QoS in modern Software-Defined Networks (SDN) for ensuring reliable performance of crucial applications and services
- Describe the steps and best practices for optimally deploying QoS and understand the network elements involved in an enterprise end-to-end QoS deployment, as well as the importance of QoS interaction between the enterprise and service provider networks

## Essentials
The learner should possess the knowledge and skills associated with the Cisco Certified Networking Associate Implementing and Administering Cisco Solutions (CCNA).

## Audience
- Pre- and post-sales technical engineers responsible for designing, implementing, or troubleshooting networks
- Network architects responsible for designing multiservice networks to carry voice, video, and data traffic in enterprise or service provider environments
