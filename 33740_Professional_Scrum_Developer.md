## Audience
The APS for Software Development course is intended for all members of a Scrum Team involved in developing and delivering software based systems including: architects, analysts, programmers, database developers, testers, managers, IT-Operations and others, including Scrum Masters and Product Owners.

This course provides greatest value if the whole Scrum Team (Developers, Scrum Master and Product Owner) attend together and experience the power of real teamwork. Teams that attend together are not only able to apply learnings to their work immediately, but are also able to recall their classroom experiences to overcome particularly challenging times.

Of course, this class is also valuable to individuals attending without their entire team. These students will experience working on a Scrum Team during the class and will be able to transfer their learnings to their teammates, often convincing their teammates of the advantages of using Scrum, Agile and DevOps practices.

Students will experience real-world challenges and issues, and through a series of Sprints will learn how to continuously improve the way they perform their work.
