## Summary
Currently Deep Learning is the most exciting field of Machine Learning. Deep Learning algorithms are giving state of the art result in almost every domain like computer vision, natural language processing, speech analysis, robotics etc.. This deep learning course is designed to introduce deep learning to students from basic to advance. After completing this course students will be able to design the Deep Neural Network architecture for various application.

How do computers recognize objects, people, actions, animals, places, etc. from images? This is a trivial task for humans but remains one of the core problems in Computer Vision. Recent advances in representation learning using multiple layers of abstraction (deep learning) have demonstrated to be an important aspect for designing artificial systems for visual recognition. In this class we will study and implement deep learning models and learning algorithms for visual recognition. After this class you will be able to understand, design, implement, and assess the impact of deep learning techniques for a diverse range of visual recognition tasks.
