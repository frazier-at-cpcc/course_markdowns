## Objective
- Learn how Gigamon manages traffic flows where decryption of traffic is essential
- Understand the different map group choices which support inline SSL/TLS decryption
- Design and implement an inline SSL/TLS decryption solution
- Learn best practices and common challenges

## Essentials
Mandatory Requirement: Customers must have knowledge of or have taken the Gigamon Foundations I: Insight into Network Data Across Your Network (GFD1) course before they take this one-day follow-on course.
It is also strongly recommended that learners have knowledge of or have taken the Gigamon Designing and Implementing Inline Bypass Solutions course.
As a follow-on course to the Gigamon Foundations I and Gigamon Designing and Implementing Inline Bypass Solutions courses, learners are expected to already possess these skills, abilities, and knowledge:


- Basic Flow Mapping
- GigaVUE-FM Navigation
- Inline Bypass Concepts and Configuration

## Audience
The primary target audiences for the course are:


- Security Ops teams that need to understand how Gigamon inline SSL/TLS decryption solutions function in relation to designing and deploying visibility solutions utilizing these features.
- Network Ops teams that are familiar with Gigamon, and will be implementing a Classic or Flexible Inline Bypass solution with SSL/TLS decryption. These include roles like architects, admins, and operators.
