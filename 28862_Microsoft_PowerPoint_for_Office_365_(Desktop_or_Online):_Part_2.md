## Summary
Meetings, instruction, training, pitches; these are all a part of our daily lives. We are often called upon to deliver presentations with little notice, at multiple venues, and with varying requirements. And, some of these presentations include sensitive information that needs to be guarded. Given all the variables, it may seem an overwhelming task to deliver your content, on time, to all audiences, and to only those who need to see it. Oh, and by the way, you need to make it interesting, informative, and memorable. So, how do you do it? Without the help of a robust set of tools, it would be nearly impossible. But Microsoft PowerPoint provides you with a variety of such tools that can help you deliver content in nearly any situation, while saving time and effort. By taking advantage of these tools, students will be creating presentations that not only stand out from the crowd, but also don't consume all of their available time. 

Note: Most Office 365 users perform the majority of their daily tasks using the desktop version of the Office software, so that is the focus of this training. The course material will also enable students to access and effectively utilize many web-based resources provided with their Office 365 subscription. This includes brief coverage of key skills for using PowerPoint for the Web and OneDrive. Helpful notes throughout the material alert students to cases where the online version of the application may function differently from the primary, desktop version. 

This course covers Microsoft Office Specialist Program exam objectives to help students prepare for the PowerPoint Associate (Office 365 and Office 2019): Exam MO-300.
