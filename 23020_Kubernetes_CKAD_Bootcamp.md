## Summary
This class prepares students for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam. Kubernetes is a Cloud Orchestration Platform providing reliability, replication, and stability while maximizing resource utilization for applications and services. By the conclusion of this hands-on training you will go back to work with all necessary commands and practical skills to empower your team to succeed, as well as gain knowledge of important concepts like Kubernetes architecture and container orchestration. 

We prioritize covering all objectives and concepts necessary for passing the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam. You will command and configure a high availability Kubernetes environment (and later, build your own!) capable of demonstrating all “K8s’’ features discussed and demonstrated in this course. Your week of intensive, hands-on training will conclude with a mock CKAD exam that matches the real thing.
