Use the Online Course Supplement (OCS) to review use cases, investigate data, and answer architecting design questions.

AWS Jam


- Participate in team based challenges in a real AWS environment
- Compete with your colleagues in a gamified, hands-on learning experience
- Apply your learning from the course on various AWS services

## Summary
In this course, each module presents a scenario with an architectural challenge to be solved. You will examine available AWS services and features as solutions to the problem. You will gain insights by participating in problem-based discussions and learning about the AWS services that you could apply to meet the challenges. Over 3 days, the course goes beyond the basics of a cloud infrastructure and covers topics to meet a variety of needs for AWS customers. Course modules focus on managing multiple AWS accounts, hybrid connectivity and devices, networking with a focus on AWS Transit Gateway connectivity, container services, automation tools for continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), security and distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection, data lakes and data stores, edge services, migration options, and managing costs. The course concludes by presenting you with scenarios and challenging you to identify the best solutions. 
The final day is an AWS Jam, a gamified event, with teams competing to score points by completing a series of challenges according to established best practices based on concepts covered in the course. You get to experience a wide range of AWS services in a series of real-world scenarios that represent common operational and troubleshooting tasks. The end result is developing, enhancing, and validating your skillsets in the AWS Cloud through real-world problem solving, exploring new services, features, and understanding how they interoperate.
