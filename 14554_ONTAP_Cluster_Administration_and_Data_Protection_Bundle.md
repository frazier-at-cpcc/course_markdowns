## Summary
This 5 day course comprises the ONTAP Cluster Administration (ONTAP9ADM) followed by the 2 day ONTAP Data Protection Administration (DATAPROT9) courses.

The first 3 days uses lecture and hands-on exercises to teach the basic administration tasks of an ONTAP 9.11 cluster. You use the cluster shell and OnCommand System Manager to manage storage and network resources. ONTAP Cluster Administration is an intermediate course in a comprehensive learning path for NetApp customers, partners and employees.

Students spend the final 2 days learning about the different data protection solutions that are integrated into ONTAP software, including the SyncMirror, SnapMirror, storage virtual machine (SVM) disaster recovery, and SnapVault solutions. The course also provides an overview of ONTAP MetroCluster configuration, NDMP, and cloud-based data protection with NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP and NetApp Data Availability Services. You also learn about the tools for managing ONTAP data protection features. In the hands-on exercises, you use NetApp OnCommand System Manager and the CLI to complete key data protection tasks.

The course also provides an overview of the ONTAP MetroCluster high-availability and disaster recovery software solution.
