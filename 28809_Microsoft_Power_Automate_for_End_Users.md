## Outline
Module 1: An Introduction to Power Automate


Letâ€™s get started with an introduction to Microsoft Power Automate. Historically, automating business 

processes typically landed in the lap of a developer in the business, who has a good understanding of 

coding and the systems that they were connecting. However, more and more systems deployed to 

businesses are encouraging a bigger focus on end user design and management. With this culture 

change, end users are looking to further improve their business solutions. Power Automate brings 

workPower Automate design to all audiences. It offers the building blocks for lightweight or businesscritical processes. In this module, we cover an overview of the product and its application to Office 365 and third-party services.

Module 2: Getting Started with Power Automate


We begin our discovery of Microsoft Power Automate by building our first business process. We will 

discuss how to use templates to get started with Power Automate or how to use a blank template to 

start with no defined actions. Once in the product, we will give you a tour of the editor, workPower 

Automate management page and the home screen to help you navigate around the product. Next, we 

will start to add, edit and remove actions from our workPower Automate template in order to 

customize the Power Automate for a specific business need. Once ready we will publish and trigger the 

workPower Automate to test that it works as expected. We will finish this module by discussing how to 

turn a Power Automate on or off as well as deleting a Power Automate.

Module 3: Power Automate Logic


Decision making during a business process is often a bottleneck. Waiting for decisions or information to 

steer the workPower Automate towards its goal is dependent on how long the involved party spends on 

the task. This could be mitigated if the desired information is found declared elsewhere for example, as 

a document property or a form entry to name a few examples. Logic in a workPower Automate allows 

existing information to push the workPower Automate down multiple paths. This often speeds up 

workPower Automate duration and minimizes human input. In this module, we will look at the core 

logic found in Power Automate and a practical application of each option.

Module 4: Integration


Businesses will often use a selection of productivity tools and services beyond Office 365. Marketing 

teams may use Facebook and Twitter whereas a sales team may use Salesforce to manage their 

customers. Power Automate provides connectors for popular services allowing your processes to extend 

beyond Office 365 to other web services. Connections can even be made to on-premises servers, 

allowing your business systems house at the office to take part in your processes.

Automate. Firstly, it offers users the capability to build new Power Automates, directly from their phone 

or tablet. Secondly, it can be used to manage existing Power Automates including editing, viewing 

history, saving a copy, disabling and deleting Power Automates. You can access any approvals that have 

been sent to you by Power Automate and approve or reject decisions. The app also supports the push 

notifications that can be sent to your phone or tablet from a Power Automate. Additionally, you can 

even create buttons that appear in the app which allow you to trigger Power Automates. This valuable 

app will be detailed in this module.

manage their Power Automates once they have a good uptake of the product. We will begin by 

discussing managing individual Power Automates. This could be using history to discover the source of 

any issues and implement error handling as well as using the analytics to discover usage trends. We will 

discover how to share a Power Automate which is ideal for sharing the maintenance of a Power 

Automate with another colleague and how to import and export Power Automates. Finally, we will 

discuss how Office 365 administrators can shape the Power Automate experience with high-level 

settings that help ensure data segregation and security.
