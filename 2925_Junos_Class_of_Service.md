## Objective
After successfully completing this course, you should be able to:


- Understand the history and evolution of CoS.
- Identify the CoS fields in various packet headers.
- List the CoS processing stages on devices running the Junos OS.
- Identify the default CoS settings on devices running the Junos OS.
- Configure and verify behavior aggregate (BA) and multifield (MF) classification.
- Configure and verify two-color and tricolor marking policers.
- Configure and verify schedulers and their components.
- Configure and verify the multiple levels of hierarchical schedulers.
- Configure and verify packet header rewriting.
- Configure and verify class-based forwarding.
- Create a CoS configuration based on a set of design requirements.

## Essentials
You should attend the Introduction to the Operating System (IJOS), (!) , and JUNOS Intermediate Routing (JIR) courses, or have equivalent experience prior to attending this class. General knowledge of Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) protocol would be helpful.

## Audience
This course benefits individuals responsible for configuring and monitoring devices running the Junos OS, especially those in a service provider environment. It also benefits individuals responsible for designing networks containing devices running the Junos OS.
