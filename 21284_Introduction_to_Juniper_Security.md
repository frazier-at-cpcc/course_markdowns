## Essentials
The following are the prerequisites for this course:

Students should have basic networking knowledge and an understanding of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model and the TCP/ IP protocol suite.

## Audience
The primary audiences for this course are the following:

Operators of Juniper Networks security solutions, including network engineers, administrators, support personnel, and resellers.

## Outline
Not available

## Summary
This course is designed to provide students with the foundational knowledge required to work with SRX Series devices.

This course will use the J-Web user interface to introduce students to the Junos operating system.

The course provides a brief overview of security problems and how Juniper Networks approaches a complete security solution with Juniper Connected Security.

Key topics include configuration tasks for initial system configuration, interface configuration, security object configuration, security policy configuration, IPsec VPN configuration, and NAT configuration.

The course then delves into Layer 7 security using UTM, IDP, and AppSecure to provide students with the understanding of application level security to block advanced threats.

An overview of Sky ATP is included for students to understand zero-day network protection technologies.

Through demonstrations and hands-on labs, students will gain experience in configuring and monitoring the Junos OS and monitoring basic device operations.

This course is based on Junos OS Release 19.1R1.6.

IJSEC is an introductory-level course.
