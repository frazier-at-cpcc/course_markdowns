## Summary
The Implementing Cisco SD-WAN Solutions (ENSDWI) training helps you design, deploy, configure, and manage the Cisco Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN) solution in a large-scale network, including how to migrate from legacy WAN to Cisco SD-WAN. You will learn best practices for configuring routing protocols in the data center and the branch, and how to implement advanced control, data, and application-aware policies. This training also covers Cisco SD-WAN deployment and migration options, placement of controllers, how to deploy WAN Edge devices, multicast and quality of service (QoS), how to configure Direct Internet Access (DIA) breakout, and how to deploy a Multi-Region Cisco SD-WAN fabric. You will also learn about the various Application Quality of Experience (AppQoE) traffic optimization capabilities. Finally, the training looks at the different Cisco SD-WAN security options available.    


 
How You'll Benefit


This training will teach you to use Cisco SD-WAN to: 


- Establish a transport-independent WAN for lower cost and higher flexibility
- Meet Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for business-critical and real-time applications
- Provide secure end-to-end segmentation for protecting critical enterprise compute resources
- Extend seamlessly into the public cloud
- Optimize the user experience for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications
