## Summary
Building on the knowledge base and scripting experience learned in the UCCXD class, the student will explore advanced techniques in scripting and overall Cisco Unified CCX functionality. During this five day class the students will use advanced scripting to implement features that extend the functionality of Cisco Unified CCX using many of the tools that are already available in the premium version of the product. Students should expect to spend time using the script editor and other tools to create developer tools and enhanced scripts to provide for a more functional and user-friendly customer experience. Activities include creating prompt recording tools, applying common sense scripting principles, creating simple  and complex ACD routing scripts, holiday routing, external database access, various callback scenarios such as non-queuing, queuing, and scheduled callbacks, defining and using enterprise data, passing data from one script to another using session management, and much more. Additionally, since this class focuses on complex scripting concepts, it requires the student to learn more about fundamental scripting requirements such as data manipulation and formatting, using variables and array variables, and using Java programming methods.
