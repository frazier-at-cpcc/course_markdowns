## Objective
In this Course, You Will Learn How To:



- Adopt, plan or improve your transition to microservices
- Map technical practices to the business strategy behind microservices
- Navigate different tools for enabling microservices and how to use them
- Communicate with stakeholders, management, and teams regarding needs and expectations around microservices
- Get hands-on practice with Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and JFrog tools for core microservices architecture
- Get hands-on practice with the toolchain in our real-world application labs
- Build more mature DevOps practices through microservice adoption
- Understand how to refactor monolithic systems into more modular, component-based systems
- Apply microservice use cases to continuous integration, delivery, and testing
- Enable more automated testing and self-service QA capability

## Essentials
Programming experience is required. Exercises use Java, but for private onsite deliveries, exercises can be done using your preferred language.

## Audience
