Learning Outcomes


This Hackathon encompasses the modern software development toolbox – from source control, across testing tools to continuous integration and deployment. Each engineer working with software needs to have experience with these to be successful in the modern, cloud-native world.Every attendee will build the following technical skills:



- Fluency with the basic set of bash commands necessary to work in a Linux/Unix based environment
- Experience with Git commands to be able to successfully participate in development teams, both from the command line and chosen IDE
- Familiarity with software testing process, both the writing and executing tests
- Experience with Docker (creating and running custom images, pushing images to private docker repository)
- Experience with Kubernetes (running a cluster, deploying, running, and upgrading a microservice app)
- Working knowledge of chosen CI/CD automation tool (either Jenkins or GitHub actions)
Attendees will also explore the concepts of test-driven development, infrastructure as code, microservice architecture and service mesh.


Cloud Ready Hackathon builds on the concept of learning-by-doing in a highly interactive environment. Solving the real world problem without being told directly what to do will enable attendees to apply acquired skills immediately 
on their job
