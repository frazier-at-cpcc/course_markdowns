## Summary
In this course, you will learn how to use Amazon EKS to manage and orchestrate containers with Kubernetes. With Amazon EKS you can run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and  maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. You will manage container images using Amazon Elastic 
Container Registry (Amazon ECR) and learn how to automate application deployment. You will deploy applications using continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) tools. You will learn how to monitor and scale your environment by using metrics, logging, tracing, and horizontal and vertical scaling. You will also manage storage for your containerized applications, configure AWS networking services to support the cluster, and learn how to secure your Amazon EKS environment.
