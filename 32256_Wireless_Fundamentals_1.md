## Objective
In our seminar, we will teach you the fundamentals of radio engineering and wireless technologies.


In addition, topics such as antennas, modulation, standards, media access methods, regulations, mobility, interference source detection, strategies for planning, building and operating small to large enterprise solutions will be covered.


Theory is accompanied with extensive hands-on assignments and examples from real-world networks, as well as live demos from our WiFi experts.
The course offers a vendor-independent introduction to wireless technologies and provides all the basic knowledge required for vendor-specific courses such as Understanding Cisco Wireless Foundations (WLFNDU).

## Essentials
