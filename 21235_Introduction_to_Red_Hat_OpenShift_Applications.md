## Audience
This course is a low prerequisite on-ramp for OpenShift development. Many developers want to find ways to use OpenShift in their organization and have heard of its many benefits, but they lack the necessary skills or interest in approaching OpenShift from a low-level, bottom-up oriented approach. Most developers are instead focused on finding ways to write and deploy applications faster and easier. Students who are interested in learning more about the underlying OpenShift infrastructure and have strong RHCSA-level skills should instead start with Red Hat OpenShift Administration I: Operating a Production Cluster (DO180).

## Outline
Configure a Cloud Application Developer Environment

    Configure a developer environment with a modern integrated developer environment and version control.

Deploy Applications to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

    Deploy an application to OpenShift.

Configure Application builds in OpenShift

    Manage application builds in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

Scale Applications in OpenShift

    Scale and test an application with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

Troubleshoot Applications in OpenShift

    Identify and resolve common problems in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

## Summary
A developer-focused introduction to OpenShift application building, deployment, scaling, and troubleshooting.

Red Hat® OpenShift® Container Platform is a containerized application platform that allows enterprises to accelerate and streamline application development, delivery, and deployment on-premise or in the cloud. As OpenShift and Kubernetes continue to become widely adopted, developers are increasingly required to understand how to develop, build, and deploy applications with a containerized application platform. While some developers are interested in managing the underlying infrastructure, most developers want to focus on developing applications and using OpenShift for its simple building, deployment, and scaling capabilities.
