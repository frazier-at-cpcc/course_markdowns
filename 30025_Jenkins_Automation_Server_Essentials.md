## Summary
This course covers the fundamentals necessary to deploy and utilize the Jenkins automation server. Jenkins enables users to immediately begin automating both their individual and collaborative workflows. Jenkins is a proven solution for a wide variety of tasks ranging from the helpful automation of scripts (such as Python and Ansible) to creating complex pipelines that govern the technical parts of not only Continuous Integration, but Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) as well. Jenkins is free, open source, and easily controlled with a simple web-based UI- it can be expanded by third party plugins and is deployable on nearly any on-site (Linux, Windows and Mac) or cloud platform.
