## Essentials
To be eligible to challenge the EC-Council CEH certification examination, the candidate has two options:

Attend Official Network Security Training by EC-Council:

Attempt the Exam without Official EC-Council Training:

In order to be considered for the EC-Council CEH exam without attending official network security training, the candidate must have at least 2 years of work experience in the Information Security domain. If the candidate has the required work experience, they can submit an eligibility application form along with US$ 100, a non-refundable fee
